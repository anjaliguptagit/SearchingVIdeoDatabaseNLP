so as i add one of this essence of the peace i do not result with just one as petiolate but remember the law that ended or megarian will give rise to and molitor within similarly here when four orbital are combined they give rise to four of the spicy hybridized or bitten some going to draw this dianner in one assent le pere to for a spell i beacon with in order to represent detention conflagration what i'm going to do as you have one as too you have to er and to be and negotiate a rider with an iron to be in between a and b i erased all bites but it's on a bit closer to the pea atomical bitters because remember if you have a large poportion then the energy of the hybrid or wittens going to be closer to dido the pier bitten so now i'm going to draw the hybridization so formed four of them and in each one of these hawiian the is one one let tone each okay so the hybridization configuration or hyborian configuration is represented as follows now you can imagine it since i have four egreville i belisarius around discarnate when it forms born it is going to form for italian born so in order to represent that i'm going to use these as my i did i sed i wean't okay prayin see in order for me to hold these coal or bidentata they are a stable or farthest away from each other what i give rise to is a shape close to that of what that ere he ran in fact the valensolle latron peepin perry or we ciphers that these hybridisation have to be oriented such that they are far this the part from each other so when i have four of these hybridized or bideth only way tonte is using enough that reside fashion or something like this gay so imagined that the parvenus this particular hybrid stating it onion piratin were in telson one electrons in each of these lords and then i dogilani one as holbein is going to come and will let between espey i were with an of the carmen and one as high one as orbital of hydrogen and when you have this over lap there is a kardonian form so in order to show it what i'm going to do it i'm going to draw this is witty haveage within and then the one as harbinger i rides going to ward latentis so this is one of the carbon hydrogen born similarly in going to have four of these carbon hydrogen born to an imagined that there will be a corresponding over lap and this electron target shed such lady have a co wallington formation that to one of the latron comes from hydrogen than lefrancois from the cabin and both of them shared this performer covillan born between each other yet and i have a ballinscreen off o me tanaichonok n see that the sentry carbonate he has formed born with four of the hydrogen atom and now you have what is gil as he met him malice in this particular mean molecule since we were to follow the violent shell latron barbican there you are you can see is that there the two the orbits are farthest away from each other and the bone between these two barns becomes one of nine point five degrees so far as pete had relation on manisty hundred and nine point five dignes okay a wide started about the hybridization of carbon in my pain and in fact the suskind of the morning which the pole as peterie sed arbiters of carbon are a santosian imagine that the cardinal nucleus is kind of in the center and these the four arbiters in which they let translated and each of these old betailored lap with a one as a bitter
