last in the piston alligator within and to be a widow born and we consider these stable born so we know that cabin forms for equivalent born in the case of our late componit matania for equalling bones between carven and hydrogen but if we look at the electronic configuration of calvin it is not really straight forward as to how carbon is able to form these bones equivalently such thither equal intership size and argenton to let us first revise electronic configuration of carbon or be said that loustalot consecration of carbon is one as to the west and then to be one and to be by one and then the two passed one is a red arabian israeli and so if you really knocked this particular diagram it doesn't really represent how carlisle to form for months because in order to form for banned to have for our widdleton over lapping teacher her not only that the current state in which they leoni on figuration is written you cannot have for or with us in which you can form for equivalent borne so in order to explain the born formation in my pain scientists came up with a concept of hydration so hybridization is is when you combine to or bientot make one hybridized or bitten now in the case of carbon what happened is that you have the ground stateroom i ration this particular ground city like runic confederation is revised to form an excited state electronic configuration of the citron state and we are going to draw an excited state electronic configuration there in one of these electrons from the tualatin has been fort into the two pierrotin now the excited state atonic configuration becomes one has to do as one to be a one to be why one to pecatone in this particular confutation as well you can an explain the born formation were in folly we varenbon or form you can certain how far only be form but remembered the barn that is formed with this electron that is into a albertville different from the barn that is formed with the laconia to bear with sirela this it wallandoon what came it came up was the hybridized state or hybridized state leoni on figuration so i'm going to draw the hybridized state now when we draw the highly dictate what we're going to do all we are going to combine that one electron from that tower albion and then the three electrons from the tree of the pear bitters getting them together and combining this one of the sarbaland clear of the peer within to give rise to a sperienced or bites so i am going to draw it such that imagine that you are combining one of these esopian and then i also combining to thee of these bear within together you can imagine this is pretty much like taking an apple uncle oranges and mixing them in a blunder and then coming up with four glasses of of apple or angus they so what i have is now no longer the addition when i do there dition tis no longer represents a arbitrement rather what i have is a combination of both of these orbited bisesar in the formation of a speedy i beridden so i'm going to say that this edition gives me this edition gives me what i call as espey hybridized all within one avenge show both the callers because that's how it is right so when i add these things together but as no began be added to the pedlar as locke and miss subtracted from the pillow to what i have here is the kind of a distorted dubisha wherein you have one lie low out and one tiny loop
