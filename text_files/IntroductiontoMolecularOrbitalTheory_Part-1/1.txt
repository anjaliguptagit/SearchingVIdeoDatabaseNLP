i come by in an over lapage that there is a maximum or left possible this was as in the formation of signal boy last class we also talked about born dissociation energy which was the energy that was required to break a bond a part so late have to break these two hydrogen it comes apart from each other i will require a energico pounding the montecatini aenone bad onesided that those two hydrogen atoms can be or taking a part from each other from that hidden molecule so now let us think of this particular formation of hydrogen molecules imagined that these two hydrogen atoms are standon they each have that one is all within and they are starting to come close to each other so as you can see at this distance between the two i detonate them go on declaring you start having an over lap in the case for example you will slowly start having an over labatry in the door when as a written and as this distance was on decreasing what happens is that a tepetitlan distance you have maximum overlap and it doesn't fit do on land of the hydrogen molecules or the one line of the hydrogen hydrogen born this particular distance all born length also resided in maximum stabilization so you can see that the potential and age is minimum iteration to last class with off the ball the numbers and hydrangeas approximately a point seven four am stronger seventy five beckoned and at this particular distance you have maximums tablason for this stabilization is etive to hundred and five cookeries for molo energies so as to adamson closer and i get stablish energy released and disengages corresponding two hundred and five onlookers pure mood if i bring these aims even more closer such that there now beyond the born lengthening to get them closer and then remember that the protons and each of these atoms are or the nuclear of this item there wont to start we telling each other because the positive charges are wont to the police so if i want go beyond balance these atoms close to each other the energy the potential energies won to increase tremendously and that sort does glorifies so we talked about how or with elterlein ing with and we have to so think of this orbital overlaps in the case of hydrogen hydrogen atom to a wouldn't for over lap in light so in this case we also the thing about this orbital over lap like a wayward lap so imagined two ways going and combining together now that a toison either such that these two waves have a inclination in the in the sense that the class of one way of matches with the crust of the other way of an they brought added together all you can have an asinine addition bearing the cross of one way of matches the trout of the other way and they basically can slater to the two ways of adding to watering a sinuous and as inclination so i look in see here oh this particular diagram represent darwin over lap as it directing waves so a constructive combination or inclination resides in in a large trough or adding to wash together and it destructive combination residin to its subtracting committee in pasoeroean here when though commination resistance we solicited the wonders flamed when these two ways are denotative manners and the bond is not from a that is no one formation when they are diodotus manner so now let us look at this hydrogen mollica formation imagine that in one case these two one as all bitter are adding as i there adding in a constructive manner which resides in the release of energy and stabilization you can see that this particular or with heigham or monica arod butteries typically made wherein the two atomic or bitten as combined through an see that you represent addition of these two atomical bidden such that it was as in a constructive combinations as led the energies now than the energies of corresponding atomical bitten all you can
