a distaste edition when the energy is higher or then to an age of the corresponding atomic or bitten so to atomic or bitten a combined to form two molecular within and these said that the two atomical bitter have now combined to form a sigma one as all within and then sigmatic so dialstone dies sigma one as is the borning millicent and simatalu and i bonding alicante you can see the shape of these two represented on the screen no one we have designated these will it raritan's be go on telling electrons into these melicertes just young above rinciple and polisson principle so what we are going to do is wearing to take when one electrons from each of these hydrogene now we have too etonian me to place them in these molecular or witness to what i'm going to do it i will pay these two electrons in the lord most energy or button which is the borning oliliet and they have to be paired with each other you sing polly exclusion in sile now i'm done with adding to will a drone have no more electrons left to put in the a signature molinari an all de a taborites millionaire can also telles which bones are going to result in a stable born formation for any man to be stable you need to have more let on in the bonding alicante ban in the anti bonding molecular with him to foregate hydrogen molecule exists because who have more electrons in the bonding iligan arabian and the antimonial bitten is empty if you take helms i try to combine to helium at them eaten the helium is going to come with two electrons so if i now have to make a similar digame you can imagine that the boring molecular bitten will have to elect onset intending molecular but he will also have to elect one it so this does not a favored stability unique to have more leonine morning molecular with em so as it is eloptic he here as we know to does not form a molecule of aceto the like hydrogen forms as to you do not have heliumite can also predict for many other at so whether a perticular item is going to form a moitie using them illiterate city so it as looked at a single bone formation now let us look at a to peewits over lapping with each other now that i do ways in which i can think of these two particular fear widens or over lapping with each other i can think of an end to end over lap says that these two bitten over lap with each other all i can think of her sidesaddle wherein you have these torbola ing with each other if i have to represent thee in the diagram i would say an antidote lap is something like this were in you have all large large over lepelletier of over lap happening between the two per within all you can think of a side to say over lap very thelamis not that it active okay my name have an anging over lap that overlap resistin the formation of her simoon whenever you hoist to side over lap that particular over lap tepidly decided in the formation of her by one so now let us look at this pitongatan or double morn formation so now what i have is a carbon carbondale bone forming now each of these carbine pear but then has one one electron each of these perwuttum carbons are going to combine to give you one molecular with invites represented by by monica arabian in yore also went to get a corresponding fistularia rod within so an atomic arborage rise to an marigalante if i combine one be arbiter each of these cabins i'm going to get one molecular or bitten which is a fine onerous in one by tyrolian rod within which is the antimonial better so as you can see i i done telling for a carbonaro double born i have two electrons so they go in the pie or it ll bite i don't have any more electioneering said there is nothing
