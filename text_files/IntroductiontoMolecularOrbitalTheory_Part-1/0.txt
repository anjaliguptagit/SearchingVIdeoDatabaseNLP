though and come to live going to talk about more ill around with a try but before we could to molecular but i like live what i tol me all bitter sin the last class we talked of our atomic or bitters and he said that they are very origin around the nuclear ore he began any dimentional space around the nucleus were the probability of finding an electron is the highest using maricopa ation to and are mathematical tools we have forged out that each of these arbiters have designated shapes and sizes the ear bitten or is defined as is very color within and you can never really say where exactly an electron is in this space but we say that the probity of finding an electron in the spaces the highest so wonderful wititterly towards all bittleston sustain but the distance from the new clears for we were birdish higher than for the one a outwitted as you can see or hear we have shown the shapes of one as into her old peters are you sing shading erigation and also some compare a cauterization of these one is into his hall with the two earlier see has a no in between okay and he probably of finding an electron in this particular nor elsie there is no nor for the one effort within in order to understand the molecular bitterly we need to think of or bitter as was because the lectrocuted thought of as standing right so electrons have a partial nature and they also have a way like nature and we have to think of electrons standing with four meliflor with peary so standing mebby battener fixed location so you can think of it as the detain that is why breathing up in town so you can see that the amplitude can go up and down and really can have two faces as positive negative and inartistic to represent a wave functions sight which is a matter articles of the size shape and orientation of this particular with so we talked about as atomic orbital letters also talk about the person icarian and policarpio evidenced in the last class has a domelike ship meaning it has to load a there seperation did that faces had represented using a sign positive and negative but remember the electron can be any where in this our entire per withal and that a three ply or with this there is a perforation which is the metrical around he exacts then there is a pavilion which is the metrical around the way axes and he also a pest or bitten which is the metrical around the decks there is one note to this bearbinder the probability of finding an electronic fee so when we start talking about more little arabites we have to neanticut eldest as a combination of atomic or bitten thither when an atomic orbital some bine they form and molecular with this is something we want to remember so anatomic or biting it to an molinaris so in the case of hydrogen atom you have one atomic or bitten riches the one ear bitten but when a hydrogen molecules form which is age too you have two atomic or bitten each from one of the argentine combining to form two moliere with so now let us look at this particular combination and understand the formation of hydrogen molecules to what we are saying is that one earbury of one of the hydrogen atoms and the other one is a bitter of the other hydration to come by in and really form or a together it's going to for a molecular or bitten as you can see on scream we have represented this using this diagram were in no way upon the sigma born between the two hydrogen atoms so one thing to remember is that the molieres belong to the whole molecule and not to an individual hydrogenous odour ones the maletroit a tarpon they are they belong to the whole hydrogen molecule and samandari because of an over lap off these two atomic arbiters when
