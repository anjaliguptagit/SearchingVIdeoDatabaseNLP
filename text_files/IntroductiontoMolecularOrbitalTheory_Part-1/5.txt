in the form the bounding in with him now how does this morning change as we go from cabin to night argento oxygen as now let us look at some of the examples of a spectre hybridized nitrogen and if betty hideous on molecules ah so the fort example gave one to take is a mania now the ground state electronic configuration of nitrogen is his word have shown here and as we said that in order to go from ground gone state to hide i state benito force go to an excited state so in this case i am going to make one of this as electrons jump from now the two as electron to her or written to day to be all within no what i have is this is the electronic configuration of the excited state of nitrogen in order to draw the spectre hybridization of nitrogen i need to take one of the sarbaland clear the poor withoot so i am going to pay the two es and then these three to be on withers combine them together and of mash them in a blended and come up with for a petty hybridized or bites so now an i'm going to draw her is the hybrid eyes stated in a tonic confederation of night roger so i have one as all bitten completely free and then between two er entouree now what i have is for of these spetty hybridized arbiters there's sam in the shape is an age and now indeed poor orbital i have thought five electrons to place so that shoregoing to do i'm going to place them such that they look like this right now it you think one of our bottles as completely frail and cleave the other all with her self halfwits these they are brutes are going to over lap with each of the hydrogen in the case of ammonia to form borne between nightriders so in the case of a monied happen since each of the half wild or bitten that is a speedy hybridized will over lap with the one as all betuloides and in five to one of don withereth the speedy i wis i has a completely full or but in that is would they let transient and that is the lone bear in the case of ammonia so how does this change the dormitory or without the bar the born ninety being hundred and nine degrees so in fact what happens is the lone paled imagined this is the night resonant bear the foul as withybed or better the lone fell here is going to occupy more space around the night regent at them that is because it's going to repel the other electrons so there is a higher repulsion when alone pedersen so win to cling of to pistache around here kind of pushing bees these other barns down for ten of pushes them down so what happens in a way is that you have a higher born angel between the lone path nitrogen and hydrogen and the boringdon nitrogen and hydrogen and of godown so the boneas hundred and nine point five degrees in the case of metal in the case of a morning that is going down and become closed to hundred and seven degrees okay so the hibernation remains the same but because we have a presence of a lone bear the born angels have changed a little wit and it gives a different amity to the knight reginam same thing in the case of led say let take the xample of waters now in water oxygen is going to be a speedy hybridized so you can actually do this exercise and tried to write the excited state ireton on figuration of oxygen and also lie down the hybrid state electronic configuration of oxygen so as you do that you will be a lie that instead of now just one one per the oxygen will have two lone besprent so in the case of water the structure is like the central oxygen has two obese speedily hybridized bitten letter occupying one man in latron and they overlap with one as alwit the low hidden gay but oxygen also has what it also has as
