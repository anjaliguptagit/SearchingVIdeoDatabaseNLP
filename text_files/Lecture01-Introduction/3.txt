so he may appitite that for the bears requirements of our whole living we are completely dependent on different kind of initiates and most of our energies are being provided by either by the fossil felt or partly by solar very little low and these faceties are used to produce electricity which round our whole life were it the aconitine room whether in a very cold place you have to run a hatter or your other options that you borodin's nothing but how i must so all our life is nothing but i neeanee now from here i will take a very simple examples to kingie you an idea in our next light okay i told you that i will talk about levatrice for kiss so listen wanted the next light where we will talk about so for the ammonia some ones so this is the molecule of ammonia and ateti the case of steatite are looking at sir ammunition produced by reacting hydrogen last nitrogen ecrit is abundant or by a process could habit process have roses and his habit of isis developed more than a century ago in nineteen o five now if you see this reaction this reaction seems very simple i mean there is only anything which he cannot be achieved in it i can but here is the catch for this reaction this reaction as the import of significant amount of hydrogen and from where you obtained this hydrogen so this hydrogen which is is provided by the natural gas which is within reforming mallet process could steam reforming steemulating you can go and shake into all the habits process and all these things ferlie so this steam processing so as i attract the largest in agriculture the largest consumer of fossils well in modern agriculture ammonaria for for list of course by the haverer and this is of course we know that the how is insulted farrington cyanite and the specific forceful import to for lizette is finally the natural gas and this natural gas is the one which helps in the production for of the hydrogen and from here on the sisters these are put in a compressed in the compressor from the confused this is more to her a monyement mony as intercessor this is a second source of energy expenditure a money a sense withal has to be heated at five hundred devient gate with a catalyst like iron aluminized bottisham oxide likewise these are the different catalyst which are used from here the money has to be removed you kind of kind of fear where all energy is being used and then there is a cooling the sill which is involved here and this cooling chamber this is recirculated like this through this calculation pump now what i will do i will highlight all those places where an iris being consumed in order to render eive clashing from time forming and this is the third one so even in its most simplistic form if you look at the whole process you will see there are at least she die
