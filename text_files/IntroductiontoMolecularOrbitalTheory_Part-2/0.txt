the one thing to ponder over his wide carbon have turned a go hybridization if you really think about it cabin in its groningen only form a three bones read because the barbiton are occupied all half put up out of that also the bond found with the poor with the heroine to be wicked than the man found with the orders that have escaped in them so because the car well i am asatagon hybridization it can now for much stronger bond so few compared this the shape of bear bitten was his spiky hyborian with a speedy i biesenthal okanagan had a much larger over lap with dire of the ones then the ten if the morn was just formed with me the perpetual there away from the nuclear so the electron in that perdition to be a little away from the nuclear as compared to a petty hybridized or bite as a result of all of this what card when the only achieved by doing hybridization is that it came from no stronger bonds or more stable born as it undergoing so even to carbonate may have to both this extraor from going from a ground state to the hybridization order to form borne remembered that extol begetting paid off by making much stable bones in the end so that it just like in resting malemort nonage greater return later on okay with carmen always doesn't just from single bornou must have seen molecules in which culminating day borne so how does the hybridization of carbon these compounds looplike so let's take the ample of carbon again and i have drawn tears the ground stayed the excited state electronic configuration when carven is coming a doubly borne much more likely what it is undergoing his aspect hybridization so in order to do as spekilations remember i have to take one of the orbital and two of the pier bitts so now let us combine one of these is and two of the pear but don't together ride down to iberis stating a tonic consideration of calvin so i have one as old bitterish is completely fit then i have two etolian i have to perdition bind it to us with two of the poor with as to form three of a pea to hybridized orbit okay and remote one electron that did not take part in hybridization that was there elected the pas there or better that these alone the litill an hybrid as on it it has still has at one electron so filthy electronic consideration in the in the hybridized state of his pinto hybridization you can see that the bird pleasedly hairedale tone and that is also an electron in one of the pear with those that did not take part in habilitation snow how does this particular hybridization locate socinian that now that a tree is peato hybridized bite whenever i have treating that have to be placed such that or they repelled in the maximum possible way in the sense according to the violent shellen papachen here or have to place the arbiters i will have to place them such that they are kind of a want twenty degrees with respect to each other and there in the same plain any other angel is going to clear the pension with men to be lover orbits so this is what the aspect he belied arbiters of carbon look like when it is in epithet but one about that one the old with the ten did not take part in hybridization that electron is still there and we ethelton will be present and in fact the tree probably occupy a pease there are bit to that kind of goes about and below this plain gasteres low bear will have that on hybridized is the unhired bear within and it will occupy let one electron that did not take part in hibernation so in the case of aten what i have is that each of these epitherial within we form the sigma bond and this pied or with that did not take part in hybrida
