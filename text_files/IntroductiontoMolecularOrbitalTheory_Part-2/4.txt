and in fact the borning mollica rod but the or the sigma or molecular but then in the case of card when hydrogen born is going to be responsible for the stability or so when we start feeling electrons with sposed pillian in this day will sigma milligan arabian and we are no longer electrons left to fill in nesimus an anticlimax think about this the stabilization that is offered because of the stable lies sigma malicorn is comparatively lowell than the testation that is offered because of filling electrons in the sigma ironically and in fact any time you feel electrons into the antimonial bettos any born that bonebreaker to break the skyline region borne what i would have to do is feelin electrons into the anti bonding mollified with him and in fact we will look at some of the reactions and spoiled verinder looking at the malleability in which when the antimonial italy rode with tenets fed the bon breaks so as came as the flopper deeper and less tending of how a bonding happens or how boundings and various voices take place they soon alice that it is very difficult to the prison the bonding or in my table alliterative irons by just one particularly restructure in fact what they could come up with one might apostates for the same molecule or for the same iron here what i have is a carburation and you can see that i was led drawn to structures of carbonate iron says that these two culminate in louis doctors are different from each other and even though the different they bought correct noise structure for the carbonate in so in this case now i can in fact owen more in which this particular oxygen is double on that and other dorigen are single wondering so as you can see that none of these structures are really wrong or in fact all the of them are correctly presentation of carbonate so this kind of pose became stato how the how we come up with an explanation for these multiple louis ruptures that are possible for a single molecule line is pulling in nineteen thirty or gave this concept of resonance through which he tried to explain these multiple westacre lolled look at what resonances okay so according to the resonance theory it says that when i were there desert there is a case where in my aplustre can be drawn which had completely correct for aperture molecules all of these structures are really contributing towards the next structure of the molecule so each of these in division structures will be done detecting resonant structure and when we combine all of them together what we ally exists is there residence hybrid so i away this particular carbonate iron as i have drawn is not really existing as the force the second all the torone but it is rather existing as all three at the same time okay in what existed the high bred which is kind of a mix of all of these structures now in order to drop a represents structures one must remember feuds the for rule of resonance is that i'm not allowed to move the atoms came not moving it at ems but what i'm allowed to move at the electrons okay and more often these electrons are the lone perierunt or the pioneer trans you more often do not or cannot move a signal born because a tinamou because as you moved to eleonora the born right so you cannot make or break signalman a in the case of residence structures you cannot move the arrangement of the items so you can not change the bonding or the the arrangement or the structure of the molecule what you are allowed to move at these a piano nonpartisan so now let us look at a particular vesenaire takes a water have here is as it on and as one can imagine is one of the most common in the trial solvent is all so you then your napier so as it on her is a you can see that there are various gnomons and that is also pion or in order to
