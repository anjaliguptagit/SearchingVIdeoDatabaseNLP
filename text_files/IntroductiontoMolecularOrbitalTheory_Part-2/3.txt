but simmons to be borne because we can do alone pelby corresponding to simon so what i have years this particular night regen bin be all so ephie now does was a imperium there is much more to identifying the hybridization than just i didn't find it with the help of the number of sigmund by bones so we will cover one or two more examples when we're gone war the concept of resonance to one we have done the timanyonis it how to a sign the hybridization of atoms because you will see some of peculiar examples when resonance takes place you cannot just use this for mile of you or counting the number of signing by bouncing oreto figuring out the hybridization soon now personette ties of hybridization we have seen he had is a table that talks of our dull tatatatatat of a speedy as pete as behistan so were already covered the tides of borniche relation can form and be vollowed the jamie but curisome thing more that i want to point over now in the case of a peleiadeo may have one of the essence of the pea and within these said that together remate and form a specialization in this case the total person dig of his character in the case of a speckly is prettified per cent and where is the peak erecters seventy five percent so if you imagine and compare the same thing with a species ation in the case of epicurean i have a tradition character and sixty six or sixty seven percent perier where as in the case of aspiration it is fifty and fifty as you can see the personage of ascarides going on in clearing as i go from a speedy to a phaeacian so how does this really affect remembered that the as arbiters different in shape than the peer with a label spherical in shape the peer with a list devilish so the shape of petty was the espionage or with as is also worn to change as i'm going to change the ascetic parentem in fact as you can imagine the more the escalator the shape of this hybridization more more like a spur rather than like a tumble so you can imagine the shape the change also along with the shape the born plenty going to change so for example having more ascetic that it payderson allows that cabin to have a better over lap with the hydrogen and also it allows that particular cabin to have a stronger over lap so an estate born is much stronger as compared to an especially a spectre born you can see that the cause of us the born length of the sigma born in the case of a spectre was that a pet was the spear habilitation al such anes and also the born strangways with the occasion talk about the valentine perry and her paleopoulo bitterly but at these to periander or daily go hand in hand so in fact in order to understand more ignition fuse would be carries and he can become bind together now let us look at the bounding and matin according to the valence born peri the bonding resides because one pair of electron is shared between a barwaen hydrogen atom and according to the molecular arbitrary we have an maliciously form because of the overlap of the two atomic or pretence so if i really have to talk about the malicious in the case of matan what i have to think about this and over lap between a speedy hybridized or bitten of carmen and one as a bitter hydrogen when these two combine i can enter combine them such that they add all they subtract so in the case of mapani i have to drop the monica arabia i grant in the case of carbon hydrogen born ling carbineer hybridized and hydrogen is one as arbiter when both of these combined remember that i can form a bonding molecular arbiter's form the coseguina tion or addition of these toward button or i can form an antivenin monica road within which is much higher in energy so i have one electron here in one electron here
