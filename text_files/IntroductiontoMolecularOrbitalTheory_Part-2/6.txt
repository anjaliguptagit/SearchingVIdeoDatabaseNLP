how gay and one more we have wherein i moved the last one yes okay sir now in these all of these resonance structures remembered that all of them are contributing towards the residence hybrid i still haven't drawn the residence hybrid so there is in fact one more dean in structure possible and that won't give us back our pincian right so give me back my pennon now if i have to draw a residence high bred for all of these what i have to think about this for the orator seaborn framework the bonds that did not break while i was drawing misread structure side have to draw them so what i'm going to draw is a simoon rammer okay all the carbon hiragana langford did not break singing to draw doses went and a carbonaceous he did not break that designator framed one i'm done with that what i think about this between the two atoms any to adams is there a double bond in all the structures or is it only existing in some of the structures so i look an see between karinangin two i have a double born in one of the residents structures were i do not have it for all resonance structures so what i will do it i will draw a dash plying between the two gardens tambourines between her want to went for example in the fourth structure that is a double born at the second tractible born buddy dozen exist in the touring the fourth structure and soon so what i been have is a partial line between these gardens because i do and see that the double martinis between the carbon carven such that it exists in all that resonators between garganian you have a double born than some of the structures again and not in some of the structure so the heavier partial alone okay where it's not completely it what i also have to think about this which are the changes on which are the atoms that are bearing the charges so oxygen is bearing like a tive charge in some of the residence structures were the dozen bear negative charge on all of the residence structures again when dates the case i gave a partial negative charge on the oxygen okay if it was a case that i bear on etive charge on all that is structures we would have given a complete negative church but right now it is partialities for this oxygen if fuse cardium two four and six no ill bearing a negative charging one one a residenter each right so a i'm going to do his malone drop passionate on all of those light so in gardone bestowin six who have a passionate where as godwin ambers one pre and five do not have any charges in any of the resonance structures so that high priced kind of looks somewhat like this were in now you have parcellings or dash barns in all liosha represent the movement of the pilot trans an all so have negative charges of partial negative charges passaporte judges in some cases to their present at the artemis not having a complete negative or costive charge in all of the resonant too
