in this case without telling you on the desert of the test is without knowing despises the prior probability of a person having cancer and only at to the population is point five per cent which is pointed as it off so the question we are actually interested in is the fruit of this in order probably the of testing positive given that you have cancered what we are wont to ask a needlewomen which is what is a probable he having cancered given that i tested positive so that use base as the foot or so reprobate of a given class is the same or base prussian sewerage si tu are ripples now this can be opened out did using the same rule of probability it he has seen a couple of times so we know that this is going to be all the possible states of the disease okay so if we open it out diseases either cancer or the state of diseases you either have cancer or you don't have cancer so if you wipe that off you get to your clusian see or to great beds grass peoples even no cancer my played by clean or answer so let i these numbers out this number we know to be pointin nine p c is the probable federaldom person has cancer this is the prior which was poinsettia be patience point recitative notes that be of position having cancer was as he saw in the pious light when it don't want and the problem the of not having cantered is of course one mines probably of having cantered with this constant nine nine fight if i can with these numbers he will note something numerators pinerolo nine five the first number he explained i regione five the second number points easy to nine nine five and surprisingly enough you get probably of cancer given that you taste repositories just thirty taper sent even to the test was seemingly nine and in person accurate we got a probability of only thirty three per cent that you have cancer given that you dissipate this is remarkable to say this is remarkable and wide as this come if you look at the numbers here you can find out the basically it comes delcote low prior what do i mean by this so let's see this this numbers interrupters so if we use new medical at sardica frequent to storage to just finding out what the probabilities or probably the of cancer given that you taste positive would be if you calculate it using number of people it's the number of people did canter would as positive the wedded by the number of people who are actually testing positive so what we want is this actually includes both cancer and on canceres so he operates some people who pass was it i would have had cancer some people who testified would not have had cancer we want only to cases who tested this positive and that the problem lytherly want so let's consider a prop operation of penton people who were to the test out of this kitanda selection of the population wottest out of this the people with canalis going to be point viper sin which is only escaped seemed this net population is bent osen people with cancer is forty now out of these people people liscannor of people who best father in the cast the pest is extremely accurate nine imperent of to face going to give you approximately fifty all of the oftenest positive okay so cancer and positive is going to be forty if this nearly under person act these latrobe other case so how do the
