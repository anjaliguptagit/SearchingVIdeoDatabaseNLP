walking in india want is the probability of meeting a person of indian origin on the road is become to the elderly high the cost a minaret of the population of india is basically in car people off in the noted so similarly even though you pick the fruit if you didn't know what the into the pro was then the probable the of the fruit coming from a blue basket is simply point it this is the price probably now we are asking for what is known as the postilion probably that is knowing the identity of the fruit and we note the fruit so distributed the ferentino this baskets now we want to know what the probability is that it came out of the blouse so mathematically we are asking for the probability that the basket is blue given that the foot is an oraetes is a class a case for based in so remember they stare a miss b of why give an ex is equal to be off exivit murdered by the by to added by the x in fact you might remember that this is just the giant rogero be of its commotion so he will use this here was basket is blue and exercise and tilly through the oarage so if you write the expression out and i had waited we called at the probability that the fruit is an orange if the basket was blessom ly one day for which we have written here next the probable the basket is blue the sisther the prior folly feat is before knowing anything what would you have said i what the probability of the basket being blue the sistema point six and the probability that the fruit is an orange here was something that we castellated early the is point for fight if i calculate the whole number this comes out one third so there are several ways of calculating it and i again if you find something else a little bit more into two pistol do it that way as to it then surely assure yourself that the calculation is caract most importantly this is a very very elementary example of the use of base here we can easily say what the this probabilities probably that the fruit is an orange given that the basket is loose cleared and the easy to see is one fourth the other one is a little bit harder and the usually use based the mind that the eton so the difference would mean questioned to here and questing three is simply this difference of not going identity of the fluid in which case the prior probably was point six and knowing the identity of the fruit in this case actually reduced the probability to one to so you can see posilipo blithe as a modification of the priory kasius the pulpit as we moan in the cost so before you know anything the probability was point six after the news something that comes out of the process there is a of the process you are a probably modifies here some time in alities that we be using for the rest of the course remember just a repetition of what based her miss profane is befiting multiplied by the way dear by p now nor is that usually as we all see later on in the courts may be about the fourth of this freak of the course we are more interested in the new maritornes so it disassemble the stands what proportional to as you may know so they know that the postilion probability is perpotionably to poecile right matured by the way now each of these tombs has a name be of my given ex as i said eritis call position probability be of white before you knew anything before you knew about the state of particular expect or looking at his pale prior probability be of ex given wife scalelike hood so this is some standard eternality that will be using it so lightly hold my played by piet is proposed nototherboc he probably so let's take another example again a very very simple example if you are not seen this before the deserts can be a little bit not intuitive so let's say a person goes to a canter the gnosis center for this and the test and how to be positive in this case positively means the the person had cancer in the deface that the person has cancer no obviously dispersion is going to be very now what are being mathematical questions one tis new medical questions that the person can ask or must afeard to determine accuracy of the diagnosis and even that
