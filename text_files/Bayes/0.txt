in the last we do we had seen a quick derivation of this car i in this wide will be looking at a couple of very simple examples and both of these are discrete although in the course evil be using certain continues decoctions also with the canoe this are very very elementary examples so in case i already comfortable at basis there this is just supposed to be revisor you can easily skip this wide so let's return to the old problem that ever looking at there were two baskets one of them be was red and one of them which was blue and we were looking at the case where there are oranges and apes and six oranges and us two apples here and the apples and one orange in the blue basket and did antony pick a flop out of one of these baskets what we know is that the blue basket is pick slightly more or time so we picked the blue basket with a probity of points and i pictered basket with a probable her point food so the otago of the problem and let go a little bit for the then what we did in the last median let's ask a few questions so the questions listed here or find out all the condition probably ties all the possible condition probably lease for the random video ble eve represent troop and the anamal be representing the basket then we have a couple of moiseika fruit a and what is the property of leather hand in and you close your rice and you don't know which masticating a hand in any or picking a foot out of random what the past probability that it came out of the bubale and the second one is essentially a various and of the previous question which is if you pick a fruit at random and you look at it and now you know that it's an orange that you pick what is the probability that it came off at the blue basket let's start the dis remember that we had joined the hard drawn the giant probability table actually they had rung the giant distribution numbers what now i have turned it into a probability table if i reveal from last in the head a totaller of hundred if you did divide each of those numbers by hundred you get the probabilities remembered what this represent point the presence the giant probability of the basket being red and the fruit being orange sicarii have this as the probability of bread and apple extrusion see this so let's address the first question we want to write down all the conditions probably ties be off if even that be too so as you can see this takes four different possibilities we have two possibilities for the foods and two possibilities for the baskets so you could have an orange coming out of the red basket you could have an applicant or the blue basket so on and so forth so how do we find this out we have the elementary expression for undesirable which we look that in the last a video this is actually just the raiding of the product rod so if you use that now you can take it pacificus probably read the the fruit is an orange given that the basket is ready so what you are coliseo have chosen the red basket now you want to find out the probably did the field fruits an orange now you can do it in a great deal here as is done pieno so the probable is given by be off if come abe which isn't the case beeding and the basket is read the wired by the probability that the past is read and one you do that we have this number remembered as the giant probably to probably that the fruit is an orange in the basket is read this is point three and the neck probably feed the basket is read his point for appointee by fine food is pointing this is the sort of detail way of calculating this week are also calculated it enough simple way you can kind of do it by inspection given that the basket is read you already know that there are six are in gus and to happen so the probable kept on six or eight so that his sponsor points or in fact so that the second way of doing it similarly you can now find out all the other cases probably that the truth is an apple given the de baskets read again you can do it by inspection its point to fight also i would recommend that in
