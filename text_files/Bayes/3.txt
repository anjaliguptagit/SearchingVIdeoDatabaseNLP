the bandobast water the chances that the person actually has concerned argufy the numbers he had depended on the answer for the pines question is a let's look at this so one question that anybody would ask is how accurate is the test but this is kind of abaquessa you would need a little bit more specification in order to ask specificity in order to answer the question so you ask a most pacific within let it a person asked what was in at of people this cancer as positive so this is an interesting quintessence and the presenting the test at the estancia this person that disunited in person of the people who have answered does positive but this is not sufficient the cast the cast estuaray say the parson has pencaer and you could still test positive more of the times so instead you also need to ask so these are positive that is people who have cancer who are casting positive now you also ask the other way okay that the preside of this question which is how many personate of people without cancer esteate not these to information do not row from it other association not is this train about this katie's not obvious how many people we do canter with casneau like as a year mashing be broken and i could be always saying answered in which case all the people diocesi gets negative even if nineteen per cent people are accurately and answered that the person says if that night en inversion of the people we not cancer also tasted now this could be very wary to the person because now no one less if you just go by infusion it seems like that am seems like ninety nine per cent tantaran cancered if you aspasie what it's not true because you have ask one more question which is the nonette pies what percentage to the fabulation population actually has cancered now this makes not like a sad seeming to to but i will see the shortliner to base their anticipation portent quantity so just as a guest i it let's say that about half a person of the population actually has consisted so let's and a bouanyana curate they weaves her and what the chances are of having cancer before that we should after question what are the actual ranavirasing to them were the basket example in the basket example that and operable war with isadore i picked and this is the fruit i picked kitsushima in the acanthians questioned that in demades how cantered or not so desiccate of disease debatable the person might have cancer or it might be person without cancer for seasons for cancer and the stands for no cancer the second and on bidable is the result of the test the result of the test would either be positive or i could be negative so you have to andermatt te of the disease and that actual desert of the test so what are we given about the cast we are giving the probability that you will disposition that i have cancer is point nine nine said this is the first number that he had been given the second number had been given is that the probability that he will definitive given that you don't have cancer is still pinin if you cannot course find out the compliments of these two so what of the probability that you will best negative he went that he have cancered the is pinted what is the probable that you will best positive give in that you don't have cancer is also pointed to one this is one mines p a o mine given in seso the third thing that he asked for his peace which is what is the probability that a random pusson have canceled a let's waakfelt that i told about finding a person of indian origin while walking on the street so fine finding the prowley of finding an indian person while walking on the street when you have given no context to talk about the dispersion is walking is what is called primero panacea one is similarly without telling the origin of the basket from which the fruit came if i did said i pick the fruit what the probable that i came over the bubastite prippri that was a point
