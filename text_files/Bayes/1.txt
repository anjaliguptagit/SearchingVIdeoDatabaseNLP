market comfortable with it do it by prompt product rules so jest to gatto were this would be probable that through is an apple and basket is red the rider bade the probably that the basket is read which comes to point one do i did by point for which is one by fools similarly through his anadan basket is blue given that basket is blue if you come here this is point one fight duration six that's also point to fight we can again do it by inspection also similarly probably the fruit is an open given that basket's blue point four five wapiti that is find some end faith again you can see the istrians now it's what noting that you can obtain this number here titis essentially probably that the fruit is an orange using the sum rod so recall the the sombreros the mariner probably that troughton orange can be given us be of five be my delayed by the b some tower all possible tales of the basket so in this case the orange flood would have come out of one of two possible ties either i could not come out of the red basket or it would acomat of the blue basket you can not write this in deed if you want an orange it could not write come out of the red basket and that probability be no fear if of em prof avicula given that beak or to at makebate by p bell to our similar lady other cases baskets looked sarcasm this up it again released the same number point full fight then why do this because i just want to to show that you can read that relate all these cases from joined probabilities or from conditional probabilities kay you can similarly called the fact that for a equal to at once again if you are not wit unfordable with this collation i would recommend that you do it indeed it so i'll let me on to the second question if you took pick a root at grand them if we just depending beckford you don't have any information about the food but you just want to know what is a problem lethan the foot came out of the blue basket now this is what i lessari you know that the basket lewis we are a pickout a a probability of fine six to the problems in defiant there are a few things that i would like to point out here the first thing is if you do not know the identity of the fruit which is basically the example the process of picking would simply give you probability this number probably eaded the basket is blue which is fine six this probability is called the prior probability is a price a note the stump prieto prior here refuse with the fact that you are paining a probability for picking that food all that a bit baskette truth came out of before knowing which basketed actually came over before my infinite before my inthe identity of the foot is a this is pie from now inditing ity of the foot you are i indefinable out of which egan and that probably is quite simple in fact was given to you before and this probability simply find sex it may seem like i'm saying too much about something that doesn't need explanation but he will see that this is useful as i menfolks one again you could have a trained this probability he of deport be simply using the giant probably table now lets me want to the next apart of the same question with us if you pick up rotations atacoari bickered on look at it and now you look as an orage get now you have some explained for mission before the previous case before case to where you did not lie in the of the fruit on your another look at the identity of the foot now is i look and see that this is actually an orange now what is the probability that it came out as the breast the second thing he had is that the probability changes because you have more information now so to give you an example for example i ask you if you are walking on the road to what is the probable the of meeting an indian now if i give this question and he let a person on the world in the world we know that indians are about one fifth of the population so bandolining on the road without mowing the information about variating you are probably the avening an indian a person of indian origin is about point to about one fifth however if i tell you that i am walking on the road and i am walking in india is so now i have given some extraneous if i tell
