electron bears it becomes as thirteen to virgo we have risen to ten electron pet but i can also draw the same molecules as this one and that is not a wrong the representation of this particular compound a gay so i feel see in this particular second example what i've done is that the three carpenterin one row and the one of the gardens of actuate are to the central cabin so now if i can the number of electrons pass that have been used at all so comes down both her dead in fact both of these tracts had correct and in order to forget out which one of them is really correct i may have to do some other chemical tests to be groweth it is the first example of the second one so for now if you weren't as to draw a wiseton or structure of the portage then and of these two molecule could be correct in fact the two structures that we have drawn here and be panin is but in and these are i somerset meaning they had the same molecular for milla with deference structure connective so bold of the the answers would be to the right in arches in fact for practice later striding the two of these irons or of the postman is going to be sestette less and a second one is the bicarbonate iron which is it sealed to be mine just a little tree genteel drawing the electron dat structure or the luiseno structure of iron which i have a positive and negative child may have pertained to charges and to account when we are counting the torture of valence electrons meaning in the case of at sea three miners since there is a negative charge on its food three i will calculate the total number of valence electron and when add a plus one to a tettefall latron's because of the presence of that negative judge in the case of seager and ice sleep less i will subtract one from the totaller because i have to confer that positive judge so why don't you try these too molland try and draw television do structure is a practice or as homework the wawawawa that we wish to follow optatus ch that each of the elements in a lusion not structure has a electrons around it but in some cases you may find that they are exceptions to the son to for example when i have to draw a structure of boron trifle right or be a tree let us try drawing no structure here so you have metre more on has re litton in its southermost shell of valentin and each of the florin has seventy licton so the total becomes twenty four electrons and the next eppiteet the lectores so the number of electrons pass become telelectrograph now if i put the centralia borne on because it likes to form three born and each of the florentines borne with the burons if we now count i viewed peleton pell and i have mine more electron pets to fill so in this case i can put them on flowing because i unoriginate most electrocute aliment so i will have higher electron and siyaro it the city bear tree bore on his six electrono each of the florin has it a aproned and we have you all terwilliger in fact the structure of breeders where we boondees not have a complete acted and it is an exception to the after compounds like beer three or all hell were the central atom does not have complete of it i petalesharoo ah that is because there ofatulena satisfied save have looked at celandine let it look at the hydrogen hydrogen coalin born in this part
