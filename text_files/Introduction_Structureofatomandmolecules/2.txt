so they let runic structure or laconic consideration of carbon becomes as one as to to er to and then to be a one to be by one right similarly begins that lighting the electronic configuration of night regine again as i put it in the increasing order of an age the one as will have to electrons to weston have the next two to agrigentum seven electron so but two per within will have one one electron each in the ex lion that suction so my tragen become one as to do as to two p xenophon and to pesita you can cried i think the electronic confidin of oxygen which has at electrons and total in a similar manner now if we see a let look at carbonear godwin has to go let down and where in the head totantora in selections the valentians are littleton's that occupied the outer more shell of an atom and these are the left arms that take part in bonfanti morn breaking and any kind of timilty pursy so camest often focus more on the valancourt ular element when they have to study a structure function of it molecule now let us have a look at the bonding canis often for us on the valance electrons because these are the electrons that pick part in the monferrato no boning may be such dick an element repose forming ionic borniche in the case of any thallassphere cities and a ninefold all tellement may prefer to share its electrons with another element such that in the case of let's say a tin where carbon and hydrogen are sharing one men electron perform a born between carbon and hydrogen so this type of warning is coercive and boning so what i want to to revise is water ionic porch and water coelio all on formations are governed by the need to achieve the nearest noble responsi duration so for example in the case of sodium sodium has a configuration of one is to do westhope and clear one of its nearest noble guest that is men has the configuration of one is topeseses so it's easy at for sodium priest give up one electron and become an plus and achieved the nearest nobly that configuration of a neon untether hand it is much easier for curing to accept one electron to achieve the nearest novel pasotti so men solamen clorin form a band they form an ionic bon in which so them has become an cluseret by giving upon electron and clouding with ames accordion a helmine and in such that they bought form and ionic bon because of electrostatic force of attraction in the case of coaling for example most of the carbon compounds are formed when carbonara covering born with another element for example in the case of mitaine's donating one electron and each of the hydrogen donating one electron such detail has to tell electrons around it as if to remember we tahamas for valencians so it needs for more electrons to have the noble gastonian or have it electrons in its outer motion so in the case of mapanare garden electron gets pared up with one of one money latron each from the hydrogen atoms and you have a coal and bonomi the next thing that we have to look after and louisdores so louis tatters a oubreto de present the valensolle of an act of using darts a withered each of the darts ripresent electron the ability to draw loisette is very critical for any organic chemist to what even to do now is a going to saw one or two problems of to denot what is the correct leisure of any given formula or of any given
