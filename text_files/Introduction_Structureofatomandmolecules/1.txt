science known as an bite the arbiter as denoted with the notation of esteban f a raven looked these orbiting detail when we go over militarily but for now what we know is that the uses or the arbiters are also ontied and argy meaning the energy of electrons in a particular orbital is fixed for now i want you to revise the shapes of s and b r bitten a because these are the arbiters that will be mainly used when garvin forms born with the elements so as are written is peril in shape and we are within becomes duneland shape and in fact the rattle barbiton meaning you have be ex bey and pressed on with his available in which we can fill electrons the other principles the gun the filling of electrons and to the arbiters around the nucleus or for the first one is above principle the albovine stated that that as we start filling electrons they have to be fresh such that there will in the order of increasing energy meaning as a thawing electrons into the arbiters i must fill the forst elegant into the one ear bitten after that it comes as to war and then to be and so on to the general order of willing electrons into the arbiters a goes follows the next thing we have to look at is politics clusion principle so politicus on principle stated that a particular arbitration only have boleros and the pindust be paid with each other so you must have seen that the spinster presented with arrows going up and down but to pity what we say is that in any given or bitterly can only put to electrons and it dispenses be ped so that five showed that the arrows are going up and down so that out let say the two electrons in the one as a bitterest the tart then we have to look at is huntret now that a two parts to the huns the first part stated that that if orbetello equal and argyle able and your filling electrons in to them and if there aren't enough electrons to fainall of them then you must put one electron in each of the orbital before you for the second electron in any one of them just for example if i have to fill the three bear within and if i have only for like trans to put in these be a prepared with us then i must put one money electron each indeed bear with it and then only the fourth electron bereaved into one of them so i put in one electron in to all of these equal energy or bitie i put in the second electron into any one of them the second part of the hunt room state that that the spinal the electrons that are put in these disinheritance should be such that there a line with each other so for example in the case these two electrons have in a linesmen now as represented so with all of these principles in mind let us take a righting the electronic configuration of calvin were going to ride the ground state electronic configuration of carvin meaning we have written the configuration keeping in mind all the conscience or all the contempt chemistry principles that we have seen before and that is how the carbon atom will exist in it lost or the ground state electronic consideration we so karen has six electrons and using our worington have start filling the six electrons into the shell in upsal the first two electrons go in one as arbiter the next two electron go and to ealing again member a polling poles exclusion principle here so there pinabel and then the next electron start going in to bear with him no i have fought electrons ah i viewed for leonora to more electrons to be with so i vent placed them in the partition
