lento in this course we are going to study the principles of organic chemistry like all sciences chemistry in general has its unique place in the two that we employ to study the universal owners organic a mystery came to be as a tender devotion the stand but came as tillie chemistry of living beings the molecule or bodies the polypus in nature in genealogists were very curious to know what he would or delicate consists of an organic mistegan arising to understand it caisteal acutus to know the structure and function of molecules around us and organic must importuner collaborate with but mittens and visitors to understand a structure of molecules a where they collaborated with biologist to destine though functions that best molecule play in life processes in this case what we are going to go over as the introductory organic misty meaning will begin with the very base of what molecules are the carbon compounds functional groups and will also go over the functions little bit to be in habilete insight into the role they play in the biological persisting aiding to the simplest definition organic chemistry is the study of calvin compound more remarkable feature is that most of the carbon compounds around us contain only for aliment these are carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen on fact is that we have ever emphasised or discovered more than ten million molecules that only consist of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen so as we begin the course we're going to for us on these four elements and we only lone how calvinton born with irrigation oxygen but remembered that dear other elements as well so we have bore arms aliqua postures these elements also form borne with carwin but for now we will focus on the four elements as i thought about in the first week we will lay the foundation or to a listener structure of malice and a petition that you must have gone over these principles in your introducted chemistry horses so you can just read this as a revision a i'm just doing this so that we all have the basic foundation and we can build up on it as we progress in the course so the first thing her going to cover his electronic structure of it so as we all know that i am also consist of subatomic particles like protons and new trans and electrons and the protons and new trans are actually in the earth nucleus of the atom and the electron is revolving of the leonardo ing around this nucleus suggest to draw her the presentation andian the new class consists of returning neutron whereas the electron can be found in the extra uprear space but there not found anywhere in fact with the fine shells shells are defined as this the relative space around the nucleus were the probability of my king is electronic highest if we hear least are looking into the sizes though nuclear has a diameter of round tendres to minus fourteen to ten lastminute meters were as the etrangere in which they letronne found that particular diameter bosthoon enemies ten meters the animating that the new class is a very compact thence a space inside the atom are in fact that when most of the mass of the atom is concentrated so the new clarion pelicans fourteen or fifteen meters and the electron can be founded as a two eliminated meters sofia to give a right analogy you can imagine that in a large football stadium if you have a food ball placed in the middle that football is like the new clears and the electron can be found any where in that stadium ah that's though as it siegelind of an atom the shell set divided in
