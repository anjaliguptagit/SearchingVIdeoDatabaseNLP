compound so in the first one i'm going to go over the lowest rapture of agenor on night lycas now whenever we have to draw louis tractare we had to follow a particular set of instructions and we will post the by step into each one of them the first one is that we have to figure out the total number of valence electrons present in that particular compound so i have i risen here which gives me one electron night regina has thought all of five valencians oxygen each one of the oxygen has six wallenstein to have six in truly giving me eighteen electrons and clothed so when i summit becomes us twenty four electrons so achiote the towel number of valens we transplant in egnatia cintio now as we know electrons are going to form man such that to electrons of the combine together so what we have to day forget out is how any electron pads and eveleen agenor so forced me orgeat the door tell damber of violins electrons and the second thing of ergot out is the tutelar of electron there in this case i crayford electron so i will have party for by to that is to help electron pairs a pit to the third step is a little bit tricky and it made me in some practice or you many to save a couple of examples to really a master this tore the third step is figuring out the santal atom and the kind of skill structure or framework for your monticule so i'm going to write beside the centre laden and of framework epically or put the element that forms maximum number of barns in the center so in or case night regentsen epically neither in forms three morns nitrogen becomes thus said to light them and oxygen hydrogen all connected to this particular or nitrogen so arcas ah nitrogen becomes the central aim and oxygen and hydrogen are priced to this particular nitrogen we also follow all other whose that we knew meaning oxygen to peintres and hydrogen proposed to form only one bone so with all that in mind i can draw the structure of achior all rather escalate structure of eternal try such that night regenerated to each of the oxygen and one of the oxygen is connected to hydrogen that we had regionally forms one morn no when we do this the next thing you want to do it you aren't a figaro how many ladrones your views so far so if i really count i have youse one to lee and follerin pass so far whereas i have well electronic me so the next step to do is wiliness of the electron per it's i have eight more leonetto fell on this particular skeleton and one needs to remember that the electron negative atoms i pettily have a larger portion of electron density around them to what i'm going to do it and going to be most of the electron pass to the three oxygen and benefiting remains ibbotson no nitrogen so let this start completing the of tate of each of these oxygen so i have one to three for five six seven and eight so dat the way i have distributed the aid electron pass now i look in see each of the oxen has a complete octave meaning i had at electron eleaenore shell the night rosenhoehe has only succeed on on it out in its outermost and as wise as we said that any element would prefer to have a complete octet because it gives it stability so in order to give it a debility what i'm going to do it i'm going to put one of the long pale of a of wonder one of these oxygen such that it forms a bond with the night regin rather a double born to the structure of achiote now becomes there is one thing missing which is the formal charge for the fifth step actually talk about
