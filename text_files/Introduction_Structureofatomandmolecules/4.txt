feeling in the armitages okay so in this case let us look at the charge on the central atom which is nitrogen no for i charged in be given with the formula so far managed is equally to number of valence electron minus the number of lonely drawn less half the number of bonding electrons okay so the foreman gigonnet tragen afore night infolded old the former judge the number of alencon is five to diogenes five valence electrons and cuttingly tell no one pass less half the number of bonding electrons so if i see the torterue of bonnie person is forming nitrogen is forming for bones so it has at electrons so half of eight to five mines for will give me a charge of platon so night regina will have a far melchardo plus one under her hand if i see oxygen which is the single bonded oxygen is i see the oxygen here oxygen as a six valencian minus the number of loneliness it has preened pertatas six electron less half the number of bonnington's now it is warming one born so tes to letronne so six minus seven which gives me out cargo minus one so the oxygen here has a charge of minus one if you look at any of the other elements which are the other to oxygen and the hydrogen they have a formation dead because they or tatsuta you can see for example in the case of this particular oxygen here the one on top as if i really want to calculate the woman child will be six mines it has for one parlerons less half of four that means the total former charge on that particular origin will be re so just to some up the structure of einar becomes as follows okay now one might ask a question why can i not form another of double born wipe night organises something like this so nighties forming two double born with each of the oxygen and this so this becomes her wrong loisette because a fulish central admiration here is forming five born meaning it has fining to do that is ten electrons around it which is against the after so optatus state that the second ailments can have up to aid electrons in their outer worship nitrogen cannot expand itself state of filling the penile tone as we have shown her so this is not the right structure and in fact we should stick with her early a structure which is this one the next newest structure we will draw his of molecular for bella she for then i just want to go over this particular example because as i said that the thought step or in drawing the lowest rupture which is to getting out the center leg tom and a framework might get rees we go on so i just want to go over this one so that we clarify any a doubt social edge at the fort one is for getting out the coutelier of valence tons and i have four carbonate so that that was for less fall is sixteen lest then of these adriana that will be total to any six electron all thirteen per that now the torts stepaside forget at this skeleton of the particular molecule not that a various kalitan's possible i am just going to draw two of them trouncin about it such that the four abensaid one line says that therefore in borne with each other and all the hydrogen are attached to these four carbines letting each cabanis forming for burnt thetis one possibility if i can the number of
