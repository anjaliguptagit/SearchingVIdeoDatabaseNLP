and each of the hydra's donating one let on to former a perfection that he shared with when the two hydrogen in fact bore the hydrogen hold an equal share of the leonine city around them the distance between the two hydrogen atoms as typically close to seventy four pecome all you you can also or see what is the distance in a typical armstrong so where is one pickawillany and strong as the two hydrogen pareto form a barn a large amount of energies released because of stabilization in the case of hydrogen hydrogen born this particular energy is italian to about a hundred and four collocate put more different barns are going to have a the friend amount of boneset in helpin you can refer to the table given which dogs about the bond dissection in tapestries caliban now i want to point retention to another calendar which exist as hydrochloride form now in the case of hydrogen in hydrogen bouterie had equally electrolytic to the electronic was shared equally with men both tellement in the case of hydrogen chloride however as you can imagine lodinum more electrocution that hydrogen is willing electron density of way in that coalin in fact loring shells or hold a large portion of the electron density on leonard and hydrogen words a tiny portion so if i feel have to represent it is such that clung hold the lad chunk of that ireton dante of the hydrogen including one this is because luinis much more electronic at if you really see that deference in electronized of chlorine and hydrogen it is three for glory and to point one for hidden so which is around point nine units whenever they lectricity difference as between the two elements is more than point five year nets lockport ular born is quailed as buller coalin so a police born is of a pillion born meaning the electron par is shed with tween the tellement but the electron density is not shed equally between the tillemont in the case of hydrogen glorie i dugan because it was a very tiny portion of electron vanity has a partial positive charge on it and closing on the other hand we have a partial negative charge on it so you will see these data mines and delaplaine on on atoms and or elements in various compounds and deepen the chunk of the electron than city that they hold information of a particular born
