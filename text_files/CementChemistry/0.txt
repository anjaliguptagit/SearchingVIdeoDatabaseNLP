he testemony of you in the last last serve with talking about the evolution of hydration frets and i was talking about the defenceless by which he is an actually occurs so you have the same particles which are presented videos different sizes the smallest ones come immediately into solution and rapidly to the formation of the initial hyperion elects but the larger particles which are of the size ten to forty micron or above have as lightly to find mechanism the surface of these particles starts the resolution very early but once you form initial high rate laronde which come is composed of out of her fetch and aching right the water then has to go through these liars to start higrading the remaining unhired cement at since it and one that happens you have otasco an insect or a topolica reaction that leads to the formation of inertia it so this automatically tell you that there's going to be some difference in the way that all in the structure of the out of the sage and in a siege key so other words out of her such as forming other quickly then as it forms after a constable ideas you have if you look at the structure by a word one day you'll see that mostly have only or the says you want we will see the inner seas on the season the cachemirian greens i soulter that you can start picking out the interfectori clearly after about seven days of irish it so now what happens is in the initial stages you may see that some of these particles which are dissolving to the outside it i i told you that that disillusion from the serfs of the particles to the old side that lets a hoist out of product kay some particles weismann ough that they completely end of dissolving and producing the hydrates on the outside leaving behind an empty shell ka some particle as one enough to leave behind and implicit so you only have the high deleting the particle but the particle it self is not pavereau okay the score this sort of a system is cold a hardly grain ka the is menace hardly who worked with the precedent it purvey to show that inane of partially disorder in greens case beseeming set up partially i treated on the old side and in the case you see actually a remnant of surendra which has a gap between the green and the hydration pout which is our side gate gape so that means that this crines is in the process of the solution and producing the hydrates on the out of the retys this gates getting created in this case the cap is completely filled up the entire space where the green used to be a lie so this must be true for smaller sizes grains which are dissolving outwards and forming the hydrate products around and leaving behind empty shell in the place where the genius to be a liar okay now when you move towards the larger custos you form for the score into and out of the sage so one example is sunites complex michette of contrite you can see that in concrete you obviously have different faces you have the sandbars you have the comings which are very white in color i tell you why that happens you have particles which are almost completely hid rated to see this white cement and a uneducated what is we marked as seisachtheia yet okay and then you have these whitish deposits here you see the whitest positron the aggregate and some in the past have italianly defense of grey as compared to words this i don't see particles and probably the freshettes compared to wordless and that region lokas this sort of a microtus obtained from a back scattered electron image in that collaborate like drawn image so there's back scattering microscope is one part of your scanning a lectern microscope which you commonly call us a hen redescending a lion microscope now here what happens is the other boffalora which is incident on your object that you want to study a and in back scatter your object is very finely polished so over very fine polish on your object so we electrons that are impinging on your object will now get reflected kitalbarra they get scattered from the
