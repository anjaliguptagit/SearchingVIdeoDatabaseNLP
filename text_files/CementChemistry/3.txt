the order is it has more forced less thence ah now what you will find the you do a proper analysis of the compilation the thesee is that it's an just caumont silica it illanoan some alumina self okay i'm sorry this is not silica here this is self or okay this is the regular chemistry notation and not semicivilization so i should say self for her look and the out of the sage leontine more inclusions of sulpher and alumina primally because i told you a liar the monsalvat that forms has very fine grisliness and that is gently found intermix with the these kate aramis that are forming in the system a genitraf micro crestline scales and because of that dear intimate the seed so fido as port an anses of the composition of the siege you find that there's a lot more element in sulphur as a post to interest and again or as i was talking earlier in her seasides formed with large green were as out of her satisfied with smaller greens or so it be again for the most part being of more sites in solothurn the standers estimate just sites rather then with see to it because most of the times will not find sufficient evidence of sea to his having produced this nice a contrast between the difference as such take book another picture of the entire out the parts again hear what is when sues how is the formation of this interior decease related to the hitalian part so the idea hit ablution atoned and water tell you that for the first thirty to forty hours or so all your farming is the lord and city sees itch or the which went out of his age can and then in the long term your forming more and more of them in a sea way again now the picture ah it's a very popular parturition of the left by a person named ball starts man he's at the unity in the us nations to the tender titely and they've done extensive a moreover on and the standing microscope of concrete by scannadio copy so this is a very nice pictures of very high magnification image of again you have the city sparkle with the sounding lyre of inter sese you'll be out of porrect in this case the are the product looks a lot bout pores gascon pared to the inappreciable is almost looking black lace looking very duck kibes it's gorlat more porosity why does that happen i think because in this system you may have more work it may be a high water assimilations system if you want to really make out the distinction between interiors where he well you need to move to highwater because then the porosity in the older seats be very large key again you can see here the disintegrated is produced by the catch of hydrogen kay you can see that there is a difference he of great produce becalmed and i sure sometimes later which actually used tell you that in some cases these three as green can be completely hydrated to famish and she sometimes little for before that let's then try and at the sun on is driving the speed at wisteria tion a sly happens what the parameters that governed the kind i ticks of the speed of the cementation process so again we talked about the fact that first we have the solution right from the surface of this simeltaneous particles you ave the solution the second is i rate start growing the crystalline irate are growing and then there's division of water through the hydrate and again your forming the inner materials in inmates so looking at this what do you think will be the parameters that affect the speed which this happens in a tell me something which can speed up the rate of the solution of the semi highest beseecheth cement more finer then obviously the rate of the solutions going to be increased catwater conditions will lead to an increase temperate if you increase the template system the reader disillusion will go up possibly the red of custom mission also go up and possibly the red of the vision also we go up or temperature the water increase your hydration significantly anseremme let okay what it yes the purtiest because again isom be you have i one consecration of the percolation so if there are ion expecs in war they may affect one way or the other the dissolution process that is sapping it desolation toes can be affected by the iron explained of the poseetion and that may be contribute
