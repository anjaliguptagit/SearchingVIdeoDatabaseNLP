and which could be used for one of the media thing like transportation and all now if it is not that the binding very knew the concept of viands as old as they wading human race he went being had been using different kind of sin the discovery of fire human being has been burning by a mass since ages for its most fundamental to the most complex requirements but what is important to no kid is that what is the current roll instead of directorin as i have shown you out here i looked through and in the slight he looked with the sewer the is the traditional root or what we are telling is from this root the says what is the dream why this so this daughter languard you see why when we want it to convert them more efficiently because the amount of energy which is generated by burning a log of wood as compared to by certain chemical process if he could convert it in such a way that we generate sufficient amount of bodies or other product then they are combustibility their energy efficiency is much more high this is where the whole roll off of commerce the sister the whole trusted a of byronian how we can convert these naturally valable by mars into products of highcombe ity product of hightalian much more cleaner form of energy skites exclusively mine and now i will add one more to mention to this if you think of it water happened to the ages now these by masseria about all this differently gorditas he took avowals we talk anemones to don mike will was to doctor elderly taken so forth through the ages under the earth in high pressure through ages billions of years under the earth high head i he and just ring in the triangle pressure they have converted to the product ly cold and will so actually the nature has done this prophet over billions of years to one which i showed you and think now what we really wanted to do if nature has done it and nature has done it at high pressure lack of oxygen deep inside her now if we know this process say for example now left again the concentred on the light he we know this process of conversion some way or other if i know this whole process on nature has done it okay now gold we on her is the critical point i realize if we knew exactly this whole reaction has taken far one billion ear or one million or whatever if you know the time and if you know that the action good will learn from nature and do those reactions in a controling which in serotina billions of years could happen in few days so in other words the other area of birney is to learn those processes which nature does or nature has done over billions of years nature has learned to it so the inspiration for the conversion of bomas all is coming back to the light so that inspiration for all this conversion of bomas has to be drawn from here to fitin here and there where we believed we liable to make a difference i so safe raxalpe now their three things let me because this is a very critical flight for erastus and lets the gain a legatee what we talked about so we talk about the word carbine a balyika component in
