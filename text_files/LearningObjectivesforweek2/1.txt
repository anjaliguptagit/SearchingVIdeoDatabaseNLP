really matters they want a confirmation in this is outside haines had represented will see this in chapter you want a confirmation such that this oxide and the halogen are going exactly opposite to each other that is because in order to break this sex bond the oxide has to put electrons in to the anti bonding molecular orbital of this particular carbon halogen born okay now it cannot do that if you cannot achieve this kind of confirmation it cannot do this kind of the action so that the reason why this is possible is because that oxygen in fine the anti bonding or bitten right next to it and can easily put it electrons such that the carbon and the hidebound breaks if i tried in this reaction with us a sis hallidie something like this where both oxygen as well as the halo one going in the same place i can never have upon formation like this the two confirmations that are possible are the more like this of the sis one way so though and a bonding of the carbon alien born goes here so this is what too far for this oxygen to potations it is not able to do that the other conformation that i can adopt is this okay i'm going to draw it here again the anti bonding of the carbon halogen born is somewhere here and this oxygen reliant put electrons in that particular antivenin orbit so as you can see depending on the kind of confirmations really bes structures have drawn here are confirmations in this chapter were going to be a terror and alice is a psychogenetic structures and you will be able to draw this structure after we are done with chapter my whole aim to show you this right now is that confirmation really affects the activity and we will go over these reactions later on in the corespondent chapters but when we are going over those reactions remember that it is upon formation that play a usual in the valdemosa so the important learning objectives of this week are folly drawing newman projections of simple elkins and establishing their relative stabilities based on stagger and eclipse into the action drawing cyclone forms from the dash in with their structures drawing the cyclical flips effectively between the two charwoman is the bility of each chair so also being able to tack nice the more stable cacoethes that ivied to getting out the posing of molleston formation or at perticular temperature and i didn't fying various types of isomer to these main clue constitutional and confirmation alisma the hope we have a really good week of learning conformation all analysis
