then come to be to at the start of every week i'm going to go over the introduction to the chapter but i am most importantly going to go over to learning objective for that week so will looking at the lectures you can really focus on the concepts that i have said or the concept that i have elaborated during this with you which really talked about the loaning objectives you can pay close attention to those concepts will we are going over to a weak will you so this week we are going to start studying the structures of the organic molecules and we are on a beggarly in conformation analysis for what is gone formation al analysis the difference specialised tagamoyo can adopt duportail around the internal sigma bonds is coles conformations this rotation as possible about signalman and not really possible woltons as wife seen before and this rotation really means that while the localizing of atoms the same the molecule as a whole can it often number of different ships the structures that only the forbes on the shape of the molecule all based on the difference in the relation around the signalman i poison for nationalized owes all even conformers so this chapter focuses on badius confirmation al isomers for deference simpling and their energetic why is the energy portent because understanding of the forces at work or the really the energy associated with these processes is importing because the structure of the molecule can have significant influence on the melicertes especially vitality of a molecule okay so although we are going to just a simple and canes or simplicifolia groups really in this particular chapter the same principles of conformation analysis can be expanded to others or functional rootin can be applied to the functional coops will so were also gone i look at various times of imogen a start with constitutional life somers ah just fun fact of you must have heard about green b and the worker bees lit the way between the and the worker be kind of senses or a signal or are actually to be on to dualism one of them is a secondary alcohol were as the other one is a primary alcohol we are also gone a locket various other kind of a isomers such as telecommunications the moronia iona is so merchant on a sistance riches really just as tedious some of these male elaborately studying the next chapter as well but pay attention to the kind of isoult went or talk about in the chapter so i were saying on formation really affect the activity straight at wanyana and at this point the example may seem like not really are easy to understand when i'm going to go over one reaction this is a reaction which dogs about a boid formation if oxide is a functional group in which you have a trying to levering went of two garments and one oxygen okay okay no one of the reaction said goes over the portadown is if you have a halo high drin hiloire meaning you for hagen and hidden next to it if i subject this to bite then you can have an oxide formation using this mechanism and don't go fer the mechanism right now but you can just imagine that such a reaction takes place now the trick to this holy the action is that you cannot just work with any hello hirin a hallo i din should be such that it can have the oath under halogen going in opposite direction so we should really work with trans hello hydrant i do we work with transient because again the confirmation that this particular hell hirin can take or in the case
