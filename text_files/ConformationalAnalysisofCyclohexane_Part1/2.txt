because i don't want to draw all of them said that it becomes messy okay so let us look at this particular hydrogen which is currently in the hall upon right so so this is the hydrogen which is currently in the eggshell upon case at this is though particular i do in her the alone okay so that's the one we talking about now what happens as this chair in the ten words is that the head will become the leg of the chair and the legs will become the head of the chersonese two diagrams to this particular had her has become the leg of despotical a chat rise very member letiga in this particular as the chairing teawa the head has become the leg now the same way i want to go intercedes chad as you can see as i twist this and make the head become the legs what has happened the band it was each hill up before okay said the swedes station before the the yellow welcher or the alloying it is as her up but as i endeavored in with arms equatorial up open so i'm going to tie this as a cheap and as it indecent to the other chair this becomes it with oil of now let us try to for it on some other position some going to put it on on one of those equatorial positions okay so let's put it here so now let us look at this particular situation if this carrington what's going to happen is that this is going to go up and missus on a gold down as it is held of which the band it was equatorial will become a hell as the chair flips so as you can imagine as the chair in openwork what happens is that though grotta are echeloned equatorian the blues at equatorian welton to excel but if you have no tissot the aghyl up still remains i quiteria up okay and a heron will we do it with all your long fit so up and up will stay be constant as the chairing the converts down and down billstickers what changes the notation of exiled equatorial one of the good things to notice of her i have a proper kind of a haranguing in a person sitting like this one of the good things to notice is that as the jarring the converts to four torments which as the seat of the chair of one two three and four these four garden a loveland their place okay so for example when the chairing decanters this particular harkaman will become the leg garden and then this particular lecain will become the head carnesecchi will look after in the conversion before it was like this after interconversion is congolese as a result of which the middle seat of the chair before guenther child do not really change their position okay when i say they don't change their position i understand that though groups on those gardens are gone to change their orientation to okay so i'm going to look at a couple of clips here and go on to practise how to draw salaams first then we are going to practise how to draw the flits okay but before we go ahead and do all those things i want for us and how this plurally affects the energetic of the system to begin with we had a cycloidal which was in the chair form and then we said that is going to go to this opposite car which is the middle image of the same chit but remember that as this molecule interpret words is going to bore through my tile confirmations in between and if you really see if i start from one chair on the molecules through i cannot directly ah a tilter other chat i have to do a couple of confirmations in between so plastered with something gildas a half chit okay so the is in of the representation of her half car now half care one of the most anstey were gone horation of psychic in the half tarascon see that at a lot of torments train there is a lot of tournelles of the ear
