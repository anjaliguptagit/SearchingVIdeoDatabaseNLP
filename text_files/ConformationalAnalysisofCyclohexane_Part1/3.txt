in indirections so as i started from a chair i father begot this half stair but haltered one of the most energetic forms of the or conomo of this earth i could exams what kind to happen is that the monica is not worthy stable in this hussar form and in fact it is going to go to it's going to try and twistings these so the is worded will look like a title to west in order to avoid those eclipsing interactions this particular form is called as it westbottom okay so westmoreland stable it is still on the most stable form of gay acting the sitewation ah this is still not the most stable form say but it is a little more stable than harger in which we had flied pale of satirising into action in order to for this conward the particulars in the pension remembered that the legatee the head and the head as to become the leg so now we have more the legs from here all the way up to the upper positions as vigitill become the head of the next chair but in the meanwhile look at what you achieve this particular conformation is called a u boat conformation okay we are started from their they've gone to half chair we pant to after that we look at is to isadore formation it followed by which the molecular chief about confirmation now bought conformation is again one of the more unstable one for more of cyclical as you can imagine what is happening in the boat confirmation is that for me have these eclipsing interactions between these egouts pay these this is one perdicone part you have to pass off seating into action but you also have something which is because of these placebos he so you can imagine that honor but if a person is sitting like that on a board is kind of in him the porters something like that but as you can imagine this particular board here has lad poles which are going to come closer to each other these two hydroflame i won to come closer to each other in the vorstadt repelling each other okay so there's a lot of steady strain especially if the group is something other than hydrogen to hydrogen are really small size but if you want to go for that like a matador at a loop and had the group that is present on these gargan they are really not going to find it easy to accommodate themselves into this small space so what happened is that in the boat you have a lot of sterile as the regent of which bore is not really the most stable conformant and the energy goes again in order to a wild this kind of unfavourable situation the molecule underwaist bought conformation some more like this then it go under god the half chair in the other direction okay and then you have the chair for mining the other directions so now we have and even odeon chaloner going to all the contrition that he pelletan place so i have a grace which goes through chain had chair this board and so on it also shows you the energies of these contours so be a sound that chase to be the lower most energy confirmation of secretan and we start and as i said half car because of the torment train is a proximately dwell point one cloister more higher in energy and the chair with board becomes around five point regularities higher but under the hand because of these like pollination as you can imagine the comes sponte gloires more and stable than the chart a prison if i go on in the converting the chair from one chair to another the molecule goes to god his entire sicond the energy of the molecule keeps on changing as it goes from one can for merton other if i ask you a question that i drove the brithwoods happening is the molecule lock in the chair arm is a monica lost in the boat palm is a molecule kind of moving around and the dancer with this question is the pending on the temperature the molecules to choose what is going to happen so i do temperature the molinist constantly moving such that we are going from one chair to another in fact each of these gardens taking the town in order to become the hearin of the chat okay in a
