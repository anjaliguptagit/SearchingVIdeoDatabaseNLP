defect this can miss the old something gilland i aspect roscoe which is nuclear magnetic residence pictures cope and animal held you predetermined if there are different types of perticular items of for example in hydrogen and a man there weren't to tell you as you have different types of hydrogen in the molecule in carven and mother went to tell you if you have different kinds of carven in the molecule or for a sylvan wearing all the cardinal the same you expect to see just one particular peak in the animal and in fact that is what you observe is that you just ob the one peak all the carbons of pierre and give you one single pet what about the hydrogen so far on to look at the hydrogen and marrow cycle helen i really i should be able to see two peaks right because a risaldar different than the egeria and there in a different and my ment as compared to the quitonian but if we really do the cilician hydrogen and a mar at omarite you just see one single peace that on one point four pepysian meaning that all of these hydrogen has given me just once figment s why is that that is because the molecules constantly intervened between each other and you clearly have no way to detect one particular hydrogen different from the other so this is like if you're moving around by where quickly and if you are an angry to capture for it the same time and truesdale really know what is going to happen is that the cameras not going to be able to detect one particular pose compared to that than any one to get a very fury picture so a room than pressure that is what is happening is that the anima camera is not a precise enough to click pictures of these particular cyclona mation but now what if i low the temperature and i take away then age this molecule remembered the molecule has to go through all of these energetic on formation as as we saw on this particular grave right if i take away the energy that it has in order to go through the half jarette board and then to the other chair i may be a bit to lock the portland molecule in her chair form i want this malicious in a particular chair for you can see that though it albanian from the equatorial and so in fact secreted show a complete the pendent animal meaning depending on the temperature as i go on loring that amplitude i start seeing that the red to types of hydrogen in the particular cycling thing a really indicating the excellent equatorial positions okay snow we have one to quickly go were how could rastle insane properly and how to assign groups on the cyclopean has the decoration to this structure a on the chair to what i'm going to force does i'm going to give you a quick to dorian how to draw a sigean chair okay to what we going to do for this room being to warn to parlimint says that they are a little apart from each other and then and going to do join these two lines using a wee okay so these two will get together and be to billet together now if you really bardenton to this particular cyclopean you will notice that there are the dead line which are very paleetable these two lines will be peletier okay then we have these two lines will be parlance okay and then we all so have these two lines palatch somewhat paddles which other so that's how the chair should really look okay now in order to assign troops on the cyclopean one of the things i want to was you guys to remember is that let's say this is the head of the chair but ah you are to remember that the head points high so though acero on the chair head and always has a point high which is between it has to go up okay so what i am going to do here is that i am going to draw an age all up on this particular chit okay for sly that is my head carbonaro to number as one now what do you want to do is i really have a habit of labelling all your carbines because when you have to convert it to the actor into a tedious it helps to have the neighbors on the garments of that unrich carbines which some going to go one two three four five
