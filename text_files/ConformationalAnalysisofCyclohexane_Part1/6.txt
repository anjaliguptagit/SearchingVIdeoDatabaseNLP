what i see is that some of the groups are going toward the sum of the groups are going away from you so this becomes very important in converting the guitar to reached structure i have this example here which is bad off or to rome i iclea now in this particular example as you can see the metrop and the clown are both coming toward you how ginther both coming towards you that is with harpooneer notation whenever there is a bee that means a dark line that is er attached to the group that means that the group is coming toward you it so the is let me change the ink said the iscariot me and this is well the itbut of these troops are coming towards me so now when i want to place them on the cyclone let us take a cyclone right now i don't want to place them the member of porting is always a number or carbon so it becomes easier okay some going to start numbering one too to thee an going clock wise on the podesta ter i will also work of was unnoted a catrocker so i'm going to start with one two three okay now it doesn't matter where on the chair ustad i capitally like to start from the head of the chair because it's the easiest position to remember but you can start from any position because remember that it room the preacher the head is not fixed it's going to keep on moving as that it keeps on interchanging says that petcherskoi then wading take so the having to start from the head and named it as though carbonero now on carbonaro on this head carbineer at his coming towards you is actually the hill up there all up group is coming towards you than down group is going away from you and met him has to be this i held up okay an carbonate now the group that is coming toward you is closing and the group that is coming towards you here is the acero rat or gain i it has to be and a seal up groups of this is probably the right representation of this particular to lion and going to do one more example said the it it becomes free so now i'm going to place the dead looks on this table in molecule so now in order to draw the particulars on let's play another group of the fineness it becomes clearer okay so now i'm going to draw the chair again again for nobody or cabin so one to entry to one one two and three and going to draw them you could start from any garden metal is coming toward you clorin is coming toward you but the prominent going away from you so never there is a dash to ain't got the way from you so in this case met alcaeus as we said in the previous example the group that comes toward the ah on the head carelessly is to excel a group on the second cabin however the group that comes towards you is this intuitional group so on the second cabin the cluden and going to draw an equatorial up group on the tour garden the group that goes away from you okay said the sicamber one to an amount gainable the group that comes toward me is axel up the brother goes away from me as he guidons bromian going away from me i need to droit it would to the town and that is what it will look so i open see that i did not pay attention while on holding it to these structures to treaties such are i did not pay tention to weather it was equitare but rather i kept unthinking whether tis coming towards me or going of a from me and coming towards me meaning it is up going away from me meaning it is down so more of an ice stood in confused because they try to associate equatorial and echidna wise evora do not get confused always think of whether the grog ropes coming toward you or going over from you and on that carwin whichever groups coming towards you it could be ygolote goldbeater it you have the brougham ecole or that part of the molecule fragment of the molecule
