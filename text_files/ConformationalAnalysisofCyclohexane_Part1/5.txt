it tilly either work lack wise or and i look wise as your joys but follow the same direction so if i start clock by his own one chair i go clock wise on other charleville i not change to a direction randomly okay so now on carbineer may have this aheap now remember that the iterating carbines have the same groups going up so calibre and five will one have exogenous two four and six will have the groups going excelled down o gaston a year sorted with the echeloot or you do it you start with the chair head that carbonilla excep all of those iterating position then go up and down and so food okay now remember that every up group had a down equatorial group right so what i indeed have here is that the equatorial group okay so karanama will have an equatorial down right carbonell have any cipal up carbonari will have any quitonian down coinable for when have any quiteria out down and up again to that haldor cancellated looks like now one of the things that i have all seen roden go wrong with is the position of the ifrits remember that the equatorial groups have of very particular orientation so this particular bond is going in this election it is not going like this or like this or leg this or inside right so it is going in this direction only meaning that i should be able to rot in that particular direction so here is a good price is that if this is my silenced right i am a diis the exile up of this particular hydrogen now of the story of this particular torment if i want to place the eretrian groups look at that orientation i am only doing the quito now so that it is easier for you to see is all of these carven hidden born here are only equatorial cohen hydrogen born that i have drawn so now i feel see this these two under and carbines these two wolf are kind of leg their claws or or or crab okay the oi remember as it though those two directions as such that they look like plascut two hydrogen this one is parlanti okay to their parlando orange color lines aethon so that the erection is also fixed it is not so i am going to also draw somberest ations of waters not right so i'm going to draw them all in red color so confine of simmer that the sismondo n't want to do so if this is the chase right the aesir on this one does not go down or it doesn't go like this right all in this case it doesn't go like this the tall of these at the wrong representations of the heat within bounds okay so this is something you don't want to do at odra the orientation that it because the show them the particular aemilian ted and that very dishonest but the reaction so it's going to be very important to know how to draw the eclectics o case now we know how to draw a particular cyclical etin now like a understand how do i can work or two this structure in corsicans so order do that i've drawn the skeleton the same skeleton here but as you can see this galivantin what have done here is that all the groups that are going up and drawn in red and all the groups that are going down all drawn in great okay what do that mean remember that a regarding eraton group it may be exility quick orion but we need to understand which is the group which is down drop more fortunately if i look at this particular a credence as i am looking at it from the top what i see is that there are a couple of groups at the coming towards me in a couple of groups are going away from me so for example these tires are definitely coming towards me then these three groups are coming boards me tried because they are aliened upwards whereas these three groups on the carven escoban and scorner pointed down so if i have a particular skeleton legs this
