he down on that is accompanying it so this is guenelon three and five have all an ace he up and in equatorial down borne on other handyside er two for in six lets for was on carbonero carbonado has an exile on boring down but if you look at the direction of the equatorial barnet is kind of going up right so to for in six have an ace down and equatorial upborne okay so i'm going to readers such that i highlight the eilorn and the equatorial born so and going to collar colder she let make at it still groups as red and let's make our lad equatorial groups as green sacans every carbon has an abonne down born and it could be with orelay there but it has a combination of etiquet oria lap exceed down or a heap he gudetown in vicious traduces similarly as they exilona we going up or down it would all bornean also go up and down one thing i want to point out here is that on each cabin there is a born going up i know born going down that the something we want to remember okay so now why as i lean chess so much more stable that it becomes one of the most stable for hometon of cycles so in order to show you the stability for sleeping metoosin he born angelina cyclic end cheris very close to her the nine point by vices so there is very little anger in vile the other type of strata we had looked at was that arnstadt so now in order to show that there is minimum tartness in war let us look at the other photograph so in order to wearied this what i'm going to ask you to do is kind of look at this particularly malignis such that these four carbons in of appears as that they are in sing with each other so full if you want a look at it from this angle this is what it is going to look like that if i now draw the newman projection let us try and rodman projection on the post the plant carbineer emilia were these does the four carbon because these four or kind of eclat thing detecter you cannot see these back to these back garden right so as you can see in this war to colinton which is the chair confirmation there is no interaction such that any time that to hydrogen or the two carven hydrogen barns are no where it clipping with each other so that are no eclipsing interactions and the tire contrition becomes more like a staggered on formation as it is also which there is no thoughtless train and the chair become fond of the most stable conformers cyclic snawley's look at the cyclometer so this is one of the chat but as we topped about its middle age is also another possibility of our cherries the italo one on the other possible chairs of the same molecule in fact what cyclades it has number of confirmations and in which you have these two charioteering between each other so act of them precession then is not bonaparte in one particular chair confirmation but it is one to constantly keep moving sachenteges between one chair and the other chit okay so i'm going to show you wot the char serio morals is this is one of the chair and a then it's middlemas be in this particular chest so for example as you can see these two chairs are going to paint in the keep on in token working between each other i dromedaries but how does that affect though orientation of groups that are attached to the cyclical me to draw one group here the only wind to draw one of these
