we were you can really revise ah how bespatter subsidence how the prince obsidional favored or this favored at the equatorial position and excel wisitin so this is a body a all this cake you is a bodeful us to know whether a perticular group is reformed in the exception or equatorial position but kaas you can see is very similar for most of the molecules to what i really like to look at it just the also to can see that for a very bulky goblet to holy book tie the araus really really high so to should be but a group for example is never prefered almost never prefers that it was in an elation it will always be prepared to put it in the equatorial fashion because of its bulky sides under the hand you have other wilkes of seguin lake i suppose group then are you have some others of statues like a carboro all of these are going talebearers and the pending on how much taste particular group occupies there won't decide whether it is octopus it excel all it has to be always in that equitation so for really bultius they always prefer to be take with orientation so in the tutorial were going to waver many more examples of all disciples of gay head and potent whether any wictoria position is favored or an eel for a particular group a little of town if there is no other flash your reasons state that the substitutes will be favored enough it would to yelagin than the exhilaration now we've looked at conformations in general remember that confirmation play a huge rule in the bridemaids behave so we looked at of an example wherein the monica volenville active in a particular confirmations were as the molieres then that the ferryman of the biologically active in one of the confirmation only in fact on formations play a usual in how is large by malichus look for example you may have heard that the dean the or sea i blockaded has a tiberian it right to the ringers by member ring and this five member rings not going to remain playin the danny it has a pocket so a sugar malice of the rivals molecules have a pocket to it and this particular porter or the twisted form of the rivals really give the shape to the danite or one so how each and every one of these rings is going to be confirmation ally favoured is won to detect how that large by alicing to look like and a very xample again verily give of war in the conformation of facts activity is actually in the case of cyclopean and when we go over elimination the actions we see this very clearly but just to give an example very often we see that the cycle anemonies in particular elimination the actions they do not eliminate in any particular conformation the monica has to achieve a particular confirmation in which the living rope and at the bit of pecans recall it have to be such a tarantula which is possible sometimes in only one one formation so we are going to look at elimination the action and am going to go over trainmen we are in that chapter to for now i just want you to remember that confirmation plays a usual in deciding at the way in which the molecules
