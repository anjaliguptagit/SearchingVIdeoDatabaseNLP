action what got process will be concentration of product or one centration he acted that i you we all so nor that the legs do is mines are by a land koritto that determination no we won't do but the out ward in the car who for this particular process so it in order to do that i would like to assume that the amplitude is at home and pretend madeleine here we have to look up in her table this particular table is called as the table for the avenue which basically tells of as we go from acceleration what is though the regicide or how much is the free and argy the france between the excellent or equatorial or palms of that particular substitute cyclic in so far lointain to metagals like one pointed pilate for more difference between the city pretorian so as the group was from equatorial to axel there is a distillation of around one pointed lokali for moon okay so i'm going to now in my equation i'm going from an exegetical so in my calculation i'm going to use it in one negative form so mine is one pointed he look aeriform there because we have we at looking at presenting from eccentric with orion if you look at this table the table of about being from any quiteria decoloration elk so now mine as one pointed kanokarih poor mole is equal to mine all are you for a ingenuities is one point nine eight seven no celeriter more poteen right it would embrace her is to ninety eight and encaked spry simply by this and encomiums to two ninety eight so cake sicily so the ellen gathercole close to leonie to thee and for for thee all the cake he will come close to twenty point six nine but what is cacasotte ation of product or upon tentation of the acting say and sir twenty point six nine i can also say the same number as to any one six ninety wide by one so i take this particular clean and i asked a question i did at homemade what is the issue of the molecules that have a the cyclopean metal in the equatorial position as that of the cyclone mariguana exposition the ratio is approximately ten peace to one side eritance more number of molecules were they have the metal robina equatorial position so if you reality this this comes to be that there is more than nine tenths per cent of the molecules that are dead are in the such that they have been met idonical position so you can see that if i click a picture a hundred times like the ninety eight times i may find that the murmur i love is in the equatorial position to to titian that it is in a exibition okay so now let us try to sell this particular question in this cycloidal you have subsiding there toshi but and so of the metrop what we're going to do it were in to draw the chair clifford the cycle axin and then you're going to other out the key i could this equally bombien the two confirmations and what were also going to do is that the help of the gay he we are going to predict the products dominate our directing dominating the sense which of which one of these two on formerly in the majority the letters now tried to draw the chair lip what am going to do it i'm going to force number the carbon this is very important to not make mistake light so i'm going to number the alban and now i have this particular chair flip i know that the head becomes the leg of the chair and the chair lips he now this teshumai which will going each hill up with now both if we toil up on her a charlie now if you look at this is one i've gone a clock wise in this particular sir numbering so lotoko then i'm numbering of lip one two three four on the second garden i have a metal group that is going he could to the all up now when the
