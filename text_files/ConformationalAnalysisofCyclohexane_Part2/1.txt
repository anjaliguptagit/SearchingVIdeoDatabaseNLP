the doll is we are going to start with me alsacian and belong to see whether it is more or less stable where it is in the calves of the ural position so i have met in cyclone i'm going to put it in the elaboration here as the chair indecent words it goes from one form to the other quite go from age here too it would do thee one of the things to notice as that when it is in the exposition it is sharing the same space as the love these two hydrogen right so what happens is that it has to accommodate itself in this particular space so if the group is really billy were talking about me till now but if we really imagine of very bulky group like a tuscarora for example or to going to happen is that it could to have a clash for space with these two hydrogene okay under that hand as i move this that he quiogozon see that it is not occupying all of these other bonds are going in different alienations and they're not in pointing in the same orientation as are of this particular group to this cleerach more space in the teddies view of this particular molecule this particular group has is much better stable and it is i make with oral position than when it is in this exception that in order to show it more systematically we went to look at the human projections to again we are going to have look at this particular molecule says that we are going to look at it from this end and you will see this particular noman production is drawn here on the screen you will see that this particular metagooe is such delgada with all other baron hydrogen groups right so as you can see in this particular case this metal group is such as it is anti to this particular carbon here now let us try to to this position of metal inexecution as you can see now it has multiply touching the actions for this gas would disport the clergyman so what you can see is that it is going of destabilizing in fact ah there is a pontiana in which we can traitour of a one contriver is preferer the other so now we are going to have a look at that okay acarnanian way to or establish whether a porticus substitutes favorin the accelerator position is to look at to dexiteron that particular substitute has now when messenian interaction we are talking about one three deceleration for example if i have substituted on this particular garden what are they the actions it has with these other exile groups which are going in the same direction of all this particular carpenter one war tattheration with the groups on gainable clean five okay a we were to have a look at that because of this liking the actions there is only to be a steady rain in the system of for example there is a ballinger is going to place a steady explain on the group on this particular carben and there on to quit for space as a isidorito group might be favoured sustain goes into it would oratorian now if i really want to do this kind of a toatin or melican simonetta very simple metalanim i am going to start from to matter grow being up and we not at the caribs in the coward thing so it is going to go from that exhorted i would toil now the question we have is which of these two conformers favored and i arrayed of the cycloidal molecule which conformer which vilified in majority the remember that as a lad of molecule so it is i have to say it at any given point of time if i clickety of these molecules will be in the first form was the other form we had some idea we have said that are in exaltation that as these one predications where as in the quitonian you bonot have those to interestin that athos gushington and sweat so narrated those the molecule in the cover to have the message on the vittorioso but now if i have the contritely state how many molecules a innate could all form as compared to the exile for i'm going to look at this for declare process as a person of equilibrium so the key a hiordis particularly action will be or not
