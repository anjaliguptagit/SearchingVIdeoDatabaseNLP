text_files/ClosedLooptesting/1.txt,"so if you're see here this is the same same speciment but here we are looking at sir confidential strain strain earlier we will looking at accosting and we find that we don't any drop the specimen is always as that this a confidential stream is increasing so if we were done to control the test this way then you will get a stable response and this you can measure it is not that when you do this you don't have the aces thing which is important you can measure this but control you can measure this and control with so that is what we generly we can also switch control for example here we have the this is the axial stating this is the circumstance that verses or confidential strain what we find is initially the circumferential strangers at increase much to what you would do is start the test with account one start with the alcantro and switched to circumferentially yoke at this point is well he is witched because you want to start of the test as that you have some sense sensible paramesvara it so you start of the test with axe or you can you do lord control and then with you the acumen when you wanted so this is the displacement was sistine okay so what was done is it was decided that the accelerando keeping rising at a certain date it reaches at impot and then it switches switches to the circumference strain with an ingleses legato the control has been switched from and lena increasing accius train antillean and then switched to the circumference so good control system should allow us to switch from one paramatta and in at lavendale would start over teith lord control and then switched to some stream controlled could be acclaiming depending on the test so these are some tetby our group which chose the normal concrete i spent concrete and fiber in force conceived and you can see that we enable to capture the histin concieve our even though there is a lot of snapback i talked about snapback ely the year so you see that there is when we do very high stand concrete conquetes so pretty that there is no increase constantly of the formation after some time it speciment gestorben upon but we still want to capture this because for the structure and alicia to know how this specimen or how this concrete is going to fail and you are reseating of understanding we have sown for example that the same concrete can change its post bithoor significantly by addings fights so this is the same concrete the blue lines the same as the red line but this is eight cloathes the red one does not so by measuring this we can also ingineer the contrite we can modify the country so that it does not be behaving such a britoner and for this we have to measure it ain't the levite measure it is to do a test of a specimen like this where we have a cane that is placed around the specimen which is measuring the surcumfrance train and in addition we have to have measuring devices for the accidente want artistry but to get the axes tansillo measure and control the circumventions sotavento kites but once you have a good system and somebody who is knowledgeable we can easily get these tie of responses and captured them this is by one of our students deferences looking at the responses of different types of contrite this is plain contrite this is plain country and these are fiery in force conceits and she is looking at what is the effect of hiding a little bit of fibers to see how the deformation changes this is with this is retentive of fibers this is with thirty cadover in this is forty five kagos this tells us how de posed peewee or how the free behaviour of the specimen stinging or the concrete is fainting as they had five so this type of test gives us that explanation okay so i thought about the possibility of controlling a test by using this placement sometimes he can combine also for example if this is the stress the placement cuff there are people

text_files/Deborahnumber/1.txt,"to nineteen thirty eight the first drop fall nineteen forty seven is an a second opal is almost a gap of a nine years there then the third dragoon i ten fifty fourth almost a gap of seven ines here then fifty four to sixty two a so that about eighty years and not counting a month but approximately that the time scale same agin you are creature which could only view something at intervale six years or seventy years for you with every if you're thinking of you you were alien creature so let us imagine for a second that this an alien creature where history king of the eye is there to bring a die is takes six to seven years of human time for them the moment he blinks his eyes the next moment a drop a swamp has fallen in a sense for him the material would not seem like a solid it would seem more likely quick with this you have dropped its coming out so but for humans our thinking her at the blinking of an eye is much faster so for us it all a seems a lather long time to wait for a drop before and it is appropriate in the meantime if you are using pithom like that in your life laboratory for experiment that is only lasting ten minutes is appropriate to discuss that as a solid body what this experiment or what the framework ah what retained to understand is the idea that just a second all open at the other doctor went at i want to discuss so i hope you sort of understand that when you are discussing the mid metelin properties of the madisons the two things that are important and that is why i discussed the two issues one was the time scale associated with the phenomena and then the other is the time of europe as and these two became very very important in understanding the film in itself all this idea was a proposed that this i decide anne to a non demesne a important number at this as proposed by rene in a paper that was polishing nineteen sixty four aniline physics to day and in the beginning he is so the is it's a after the atoghia pluto this manuscript and in adoration his sad describing a situation which sort of lead to the entasis to the discussion but important thing that here he wants to say is that he was inspired by the story of profit poetaster bore and in a famous song after the vicar the philistine seating the mountains flowed before the lord when over the andes ago the bible translated it into english the translators who had never heard of heraclitus translated a passage the mountains melted with for the lords bitter but they were new of tootings first that the mountains flow and that as everything flows but secondly that the flood before the lord and ogier the man for the simple is that man in his short lifetime cannot see them flowing where is the time of of the vision of god is infinite so using so remainder stand these lines are from the old estimate of a bible that is is a story from that but he is using this as an inspiration to go head and define a very very important a mefres which is going to become the devon ober and this developed he defines as the time of relaxation divided by the time of observation so ah your motion pellisier also at elise but for us the important thing is the definition of the developer which is defined right now as time of relaxation divided by the time of observation what is this time of relaxation so i'll come to that

record in terms understanding pass fanatic events now species responded to those climatic events all right so the first context here in his cane you electricity itself which i'm not going to go into right now is a point that the world is warming and a human torsonse for it this been a law debate about this in the public media that i gain what hit the point that scientists are unified in a man that evidence is overwhelming at this point that the world is warming in human are sponsible so you look you look at the plot there you can sit a black line which shows historical observations of global mean temperatures over the last century you considers been about a seven tessier warming now if you look to the future which is those various blue lines you can see that the various models projects an acceleration of these warming trends over this century and depending on the scenario look at from blue to red there began anywhere from but a tottering to but a forebearing now he can nor that yellow red line of the bottom there that's more a one of scenery if we weren't to do the priest down hot and other greenhouse gassion the mediately what happened to climates and which is clearly knocking to happen any time soon so the point being that were facing a teterree warming over the century and a question that being what will happen how ill fiscal systems respond to a hurricane frequency flood frequency how will species and natural consistence response and how our own societies responded i take this drastic changes in climate so one place we can learn to look to the fire an ter these sort of questions is looking to the last twenty thousand years a pill if you look at that map of its top which you can see there is that twenty thousand years ago we had a large ice sheet on top of the northern hemisphere covering much of north america and the rest of northern hemisphere contract with a map and right there which shows an ice which is more the present day state i speak and my men to greenland we've gone from a glacial state to an irrigatin state in a span of a twenty thousand years that red carven thought him those that we've gone from a butter tendered change in greenland is in this temperature record from reeling we go from about at left twenty thousand years ago to write present day in a fessel abrupt warming and cooling along the wages abrupt transitional events and to have a very good delagoa record an understanding of the climatic change the past as now i look at the ecologists is to those connecticut so what does some of the things we can pull out from a sort of sort of data or we look at fossil paul and other plant records one of the things we can see is as species are highly dynamic as climate changes species migrate it is you can see the here where you can see the top there you can it's the left hand panel is for twenty one thousand years ago going to the right at present and i can see ice melts away as go from matama there but they look at the green which is a distresses based upon fossil poland other fossil plants records i could see the distress changed from being malignant us to oberos candid or the span of his twenty thousand years so ranges a highly dynamic now of course trees aren't taking up and moving than at walking from point of point be but instead there dispersing seeds on these seas established a new areas they can call nientes new populations and in other areas were with spruce used to grow those are is become unfavorable in those populations die off that's owes range ships of these species now a piece of good news majolica record is that we don't have very many observing tensions of plants of the last twenty thousand years plastics i should stand what example where we do is shown here in this diagram this is a some cross sections of some spruces there as the first four eight though the air from it from a still living species of spruce eager from extinct dishes of spruce and we so either some clear evidence from fossil records the laelia that as a satisfactum grew in the path it or not dounia so species do go extinct but bismarckian in the rule however if you combine climate change with other drivers other stresses to these natural systems that's what you can have widespread and potentially devastating of ways extinctions the most famous one occurrin to an end of the place to see in here with the extinction of madness and other large mammals from north america these were caused by the concomitant of climate change with human hunting renatus clinical i killed the man this wasn't as human hunting alone killed the males by his was a commision together that was so so deadly so on the clear lessons for to day is that as he go to the in his twenty per century it's a

text_files/ResponseofElasticsolid/3.txt,"so they want to use this image here so in this test what we are asking is that we have applied so stress control test should not only get lose that the variable that is experimental variable that is under your control is a stress so you are applying a known amount of stress less essig minot in this case and then you are measuring strain as a response of the maderia right so the first diagram is the import in a sense and a second agramant the barter is out but so this is this code the first one this girl is your step on toast belongs to your serpents so this is step stress so you provide in a non valour stress to the system a man or going to measure what thou put is what we see for a classical elastic solid the sossiges said and here as to what we are going to discuss is so this is okay it be so as i said i first we want unerstan a classical elastic solid so for the finest he woman our discussion will be for a classical elastic solid again so this diagram delle what happens when you apply a stepped stress to your sister what you get for a classically last exiled is that the moment you are placed dress are unites a stress of sigma your sister ill instantaneously registered a strain of absent and this train holds for as long as you keep your stress to that value so here the inheritin is so in hanamenu sampson is that the response is so is is much much faster than the resolution of experiment and that the effect is essentially instantaneous so here when you are by the dress you niste steppest you immediately assisted registers in iceland and this immediate is really immediately in essence that the experimentalist is much much bigger than the response so any mailly can unerstan would take some amount of time but in the case of assiculus alleges there so small that at epical experimental not the register them and what you would end up seeing is essential in instead instantaneous now what associate moment for the for the time that we are good to discuss the continuance problem well going to treat this response as really instant in is where it comes back to the problem of a veritate looking at the molecular will see why this responses very fast and with also get some idea of how fast this response is really because it cannot be infinitely it it has to be a finite number will come back to the poem but had for the time being rescinded his as senses now

text_files/ResponseofViscousfluid/1.txt,"it remained at that value for as long as you priestess and then the moment you release the stress it is this test praises the release of stress the floor stops so the strain which basically is a major of flow in a strain also stops immediately but her strained value is going to be so the fluid element a froidement if it has moved from one point to another point due to your application of stress it is not one to move back bite so it is as when the stay there the moment you delaserre which means that the stream becomes constant in that case so we see that there is a smaller more of difference with respect to that of a classical elastics solid in that the sisters and the strand diagram seemed to be different but there is also a similarity in the sense that the stress and the strain at the street the response the street as was his very similar to the strenuous month in the elastic alice this olares you that the constitution ship or a classical discuss the will have most likely the license of will have the relationship with a stress and strain rating the case where bail believe early related so i like the classical lastic solid were the strain and stress a linearly related here the stress and the strange rate an edited it now what happens to the application of her so that we have completed the two tests it but what happens to you hard case when we have plant and known a want of strain it that was if i remember that was all hard desastre control test so here earlier i had just ridden for you what mister inventories looks like for i lasted so just want to refer back to that inn in it for a minute so this is this is your classical this is your elastic response where you had applied and on a modest and you'd got on and on a more stress so basically even that though you had flipped the experiment parmenter was no change perceptible but in this case the case of the classical tiawath is quite different so this is classical whiskers fluid so when out nora modo strain is applied then your stress required to create that stream require a into instant in time high stress but to hold on to this absolon hollow to this strain you do not require further stress so you're in your diagram you know just have an instant in sly hi stress response but then it is goes back to zero so this is a very important difference between the book now we had the difference between its a waist effort of different strange histories it sir to go back to the stanistreet to go at to the previous darsena we have this is your third sofort

text_files/Lecture01/12.txt,"in what we need to know where that point came from from which transaction to her to go and see the next reduction in the finally tell we are transaction when the coin was created right so this history has to be kept and this history now that did a structure in which you keep the history and all that stuff is a matter of detail like but the main question is who keeps track of the transaction history the hotels me that somebody is trying to do it able spending and then if i have done at able bending to a given the point to two people who are besides who actually gets the money and who is that one who is not going to get the money and so which was that somebody has to tell me which one is a valuation is when is not valiant so conceptually her would be that there in that has been used in the transaction is a valid transaction also it not already consumed and the total value out of the inaction should be total valois have multiple coin from multiple sources like an use that in one transaction because not everything has the balloon coin so i can get three different wants to buy a thing what of three points but then the total valuing and velut should be the same and then i should be signed by the wooers of all that consume coins it so this is the west mamertine so that his tree that you saw has to be off validation right so so somebody has rejected validity of the transaction and somebody has to use the history to tell me with her double meaning is being done so now how do you actually made in the clients with a you make the point in mutable and all this is a detail in not where about it at this point so the cushites ion is who maintains the history and who were elided the transactions and who tells me that the disbelieves there is a double spinning so one possible solution of course he is having a trusted her party right so an i won't you have just a herbert we are back to the same conventional problem that i i have a third rested her party he maintained me leger of transactions and he checks console lager every time and quite is trying to be used in a transaction to ensure that they this is a valid transaction and oh what but the question is should we trust they trust it her party the true head where my be a biased in tidy and they might actually honors are wired in favor of some people and are a witigis some people so it's defeatures of a distributed consents makani and all that and that's where we got in base solution comes into play so trusted her bodice not art referable solution because that's a lusion alreadie being used to day but we want to remove the trustiest and created trust system in which we can transact trusting the system not trusting a single entity so that the about that coeoperate i should now back to the applicant story re soyo have the ice came factory you have the delivery truck and you of the restaurant and this question was that who is melting the stream with a sad batterymen its supplies it to the truck of the truck the is actually keeping it the very itinerate in the i crimes melting so let's see what solutions so be question is here is about you know supplicatingly and when i get meletia i ask questions to both of them and what of them point fingers at each other so as i said a liar that i could put in a out or intent of things a type of a censor in each of these places in the factory and in the in the truck and i can see that said me your temperature every second or every thirty seconds and i will keep track of your temperature where you store and i will actually decide who is responsible for this however there multiple problem that can occur so i let talk about what can be won first of all if you do not think other than just i make these idiotic as send information then they foison is not in prepared and the tally signed then somebody are canteen in the middle attack so they can actually intercept the message change it so maybe the company be we try to do that to
