Its first extracts all the keywords from the description of the video and stores it in a list.
We have a function "search" which takes the query and assigns ranks to the the descriptions based on how often the words in the search term occurs in the description and then sorts and prints it in descending order of ranks.
The user is supposed to select any one out of those listed videos based on index and particular video will be played.
